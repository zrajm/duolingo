<h1 title>Duolingo Klingon Course Notes</h1>
<h3 title>By Philip Newton, Robyn Stewart, Felix Malmenbeck, Jéremy Cowan et al.</h3>

These are the “Tips and Notes” that were previously available in the [Duolingo
Klingon language course](https://www.duolingo.com/enroll/tlh/en/Learn-Klingon).
These notes written by the course authors to guide the student through the
various course units, but they were only ever available through the course’s
web page (never in the app), and they were finally removed altogether from
Duolingo sometime around August 2022. The notes are, however, quite useful for
the dedicated student and so we decided to publish them here.

The Klingon Language Institute took over management of the
[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) Klingon language course in 2022, with the
aim of providing a more immersive and authentic learning experience for
students of the language. The course, which is available on both
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128)
and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo)
devices, as well as
[online](https://www.duolingo.com/enroll/tlh/en/Learn-Klingon), is designed to
teach users the basics of the Klingon language, from pronunciation to grammar
and vocabulary.

The KLI continues to support the Duolingo Klingon course by providing content
and resources to help learners on their language journey. This page contains
links to lessons and tips to help you on your travels through Duolingo.


# [#toc] Contents

**A note on units and sections:** The Duolingo *app* uses both sections and
units, while the *web page* only uses units. This means that the very last unit
in the course is called “Section 4, Unit 8” in the app, but “Unit 42” on the
web page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 1. Section 1, Unit 1


## Express an Action


### Hello and welcome to Duolingo’s course in Klingon!

We would like to tell you «Hello and welcome» in Klingon, but Klingon does not
have equivalents to those words. Klingons tend to be very direct and rarely
engage in conversation simply for the pleasure of conversing, making
superfluous many of the pleasantries we are accustomed to using in English.

In this unit we will focus on getting you using Klingon right away.


### Alphabet

The Klingon alphabet is:
<br>{a b ch D e gh H I j l m n ng o p q Q r S t tlh u v w y ’}

Note that case matters: many letters are *always* lowercase (even at the
beginning of a sentence) and some are *always* uppercase (even in the middle of
a word).


### Pronunciation

Letters {b l m n p t} and {v} are said as in English, but {b, p} and {t} should
always have a puff of air, even at the end of a word.

Vowels each have one pronunciation.
<br>{a} as in father
<br>{e} as in ten
<br>{I} as in it
<br>{o} as in bowl
<br>{u} as the oo in pool

{I} is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels
we often see in foreign languages.

{H} is said at the top of the throat with a raspy vibration in the back of the
mouth, but without any voiced hum in the throat or nasals. It is similar to the
«ch» heard in Scottish «loch», Hebrew «l’chaim», and German «Bach», though it
is usually said a little further back and a little stronger than those sounds.
It is capitalized to remind us not to say it like the weak English «h». When
you see a lower-case «h» it will always be part of one of the consonants {ch},
{gh}, or {tlh}.

{D} in Klingon sounds similar to the English «d», but said with the tip of the
tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth and is capitalized to help us
remember the difference.


### {nuqneH}

{nuqneH} is a truncated form of {nuq DaneH}, meaning «What do you want?»

It is a common misconception that this is “the Klingon word for hello.” In
fact, Klingons have no word for hello. If a Klingon wishes to say something,
they’ll walk up to you and say it, without wasting time – as they see it – on
idle chatter.

This phrase is a special exclamation and not a grammatically formed question.


### {Qapla’}

Klingon for «success».

This word is often mistranslated as “Goodbye”, due to the fact that it is often
heard at the end of conversations. In fact, Klingon has no word for “Goodbye”,
but {Qapla’} is often used either to congratulate somebody on their success or
to wish them success in the future.


### Verbs

In grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one
the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of
verbs by means of *prefixes*.

If the subject is third person (he/she/it/they) and has either no object or a
third-person object (him/her/it/them), then the verb has no prefix. (With the
exception of «they–him/her/it», which you will learn later). So a verb such as
{yaj} can mean «he understands; she understands; it understands; they
understand; he understands him/her/it/them; she understands him/her/it/them; or
they understand them».

Because of the verbal prefixes, the subject and/or object does not have to be
included as a pronoun, and subject or object pronouns are typically left off.


### Joining nouns with and without «and»

Nouns are joined with {je}, which comes *after* the nouns, as in {torgh mara
je} «Torg and Mara», or {Hol pong je} «the language and the name».

If there is no {je} after nouns next to each other, the effect is similar to
possession: {mara pong} «Mara’s name»; {tlhIngan Hol} «a Klingon’s language,
the Klingon language».


### Word order

Klingon word order in a sentence may seem like the opposite of English word
order – first comes the object (if any), then the verb, then the subject. So a
sentence such as {mara legh torgh} means «Torg sees Mara».


### Computer translations

You may be tempted to use computer translators, like Bing. Just don’t! The
quality of Klingon machine translation is almost always very bad. Don’t report
sentences from there.


## Tell a Story

This unit will teach you more of the sounds of Klingon. Don’t worry if you
can’t say or hear them perfectly to begin with. Keep practising and you will
get it.

Note {I} (capital i) versus {l} (small L) – the second has a small curl at the
bottom in Duolingo’s website font. The vowel {I} never has an adjacent vowel.
The consonant {l} will always have at least one adjacent vowel.


### Pronunciation

Vowels each have one pronunciation.
<br>{a} as in father
<br>{e} as in ten
<br>{o} as in bowl
<br>{u} as the oo in pool
<br>{I} as in it

{I} is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels
we often see in foreign languages.

{q} sounds much like an English «k», but from the back of the throat. The {q}
does not include the «w» sound as in English words that begin with «qu». Even
when {q} is followed by {u}, the two sounds do not blend. The Klingon word
{qul} («fire») sounds like the English word «cool», but with a stronger «c»
sound. This is a different letter than {Q} explained later.

{r} is not usually said at the roof of the mouth like an American English «r»,
but with the tip of the tongue behind the teeth like a Spanish «r».

{S} is similarly said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof
of the mouth. It winds up sounding a bit like an English «sh», but should never
be said like an «sh». The {S} is also capitalized to help us remember the
difference.


### Adjectives

Klingon does not have adjectives as a separate class of words; instead, it has
verbs which mean things such as «be handsome», «be smart», or «be big».

A sentence such as {val torgh} «Torg is smart» has the same grammar (verb +
subject) as {yaj torgh} «Torg understands», even though one sentence has an
adjective in English and the other an active verb.

Note that the English translation includes the connecting word «is» when you
use an adjective, but the Klingon translation just connects the subject
directly to the verb without using any sort of connecting word. As verbs, these
Klingon words already contain the «is» in their definitions like «be smart».

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 2. Section 1, Unit 2


## Describe a Quest

{Q} and {q} are two separate letters. {ch gh ng} and {tlh} count as single
consonants in Klingon. The {’} (apostrophe) also counts as a letter.

{ch} is said as in «church». Never like an English «k» or «sh», and never like
a German, Scottish, or Hebrew «ch». Please note that {ch} is a single Klingon
consonant.

{j} should be said hard like the beginning and end of the English word «judge».
Never with the softer sound from French.

{w} and {y} are as in English at the beginnings of syllables. At the ends they
form a combined sound called a diphthong. At the end of a syllable {w} sounds
like «oo» and {y} sounds like «ee». So {paw} sounds like «pow» and {pay} sounds
like «pie».

{ng} is said exactly as in English, but English speakers are not used to it at
the beginning of a word. Put the rear of your tongue to the roof of your mouth
to make this sound. Please note that {ng} is a single Klingon consonant.

{Q} combines the {q} sound and the {H} sound. It should start with the throat
closed like you are going to make a {q}, but then explode into a raspy {H}-type
sound.

{’} marks a sound we do make in English. We don’t usually mark it in English.
In Klingon it is a full letter and leaving it out is like missing any other
letter from a word. We call this {qaghwI’}. It is made by closing the throat
and is called a glottal stop. It’s the stop between syllables in the word
«uh-oh». You may notice that you also close the throat at the beginning of
«uh-oh» and all English words that start with a vowel. Klingon {’ej} sounds
exactly like English «edge».


### Apostrophes and quotes

As noted above, Klingon uses the apostrophe {’} as a letter.

It does not use the double-quote character ” as a letter—when you see what
might look like a double-quote in the middle of the word, it is actually two
apostrophes side by side.

For example, {maw’} means «to be crazy» or «he/she is crazy»; when you add the
question suffix {-’a’}, you get {maw’’a’?} «is he/she crazy?».


### Verbs

Klingon verbs do not have tense (past, present, future), so a verb such as
{yaj} could mean «understands, understood, will understand».

They do have aspect (e.g. whether an action is completed or is continuous), but
that will come later in the course. For now, translate verbs as non-continuous
forms (e.g. «he walks» or «he walked» – not «he is walking» or «he was
walking») until the continuous aspect is introduced.

In grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one
the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of
verbs by means of *prefixes*.

Meaning is added to Klingon words through use of syllables added to the front
or ends of words. Syllables added to the beginnings of words are called
prefixes and in Klingon indicate who is doing a particular verb and who that
action is done to.

The most important verb prefixes at the beginning of the course are:

<ul>
  <li>jI- = I (subject), no object
  <li>bI- = you (subject), no object—for one person
</ul>


### Timestamps

Since Klingon verbs lack tense, a common way to indicate the tense of a
sentence is to note the time frame of the action at the start of the sentence.
These are often called “Timestamps.” We use them in English, too:
<br>«Tomorrow I will fight the enemy.»

“Tomorrow” is a timestamp. In Klingon the word for «tomorrow» is {wa’leS}:
<br>{wa’leS jagh vISuv.}

In English, timestamps can be moved around in the sentence and it is also
possible to say, «I will fight the enemy tomorrow». This is *not* true in
Klingon. In Klingon the timestamp must be part of the beginning of the sentence
and must be before the object, if there is one (which also means before the
verb, whether there is an object or not). As you learn more about Klingon
grammar, you will see that there are also other elements that will be part of
the beginning of the sentence before the object.


## Talk About a Party

{tlh} is another sound not made in English. It explodes like a «t», but out the
sides of the tongue like an «l». Note that this is one consonant in Klingon and
is the only time you will see a l (lower-case L) without at least one vowel
next to it.

{gh} is produced at the top of the throat with a raspy gargle or purr and a
voiced vibration in the throat. Please note that {gh} is a single Klingon
consonant.


### Verbs

Klingon verbs do not have tense (past, present, future), so a verb such as
{yaj} could mean «understands, understood, will understand».


### Timestamps

You will learn more timestamps, so let’s review their use.
<br>Since Klingon verbs lack tense, a common way to indicate the tense of a sentence is to note the time frame of the action at the start of the sentence. These are often called “Timestamps.” We use them in English, too:
<br>Tomorrow I will fight the enemy.

“Tomorrow” is a timestamp. In Klingon the word for «tomorrow» is {wa’leS}:
<br>{wa’leS jagh vISuv.}

In English, timestamps can be moved around in the sentence and it is also
possible to say, «I will fight the enemy tomorrow.» This is *not* true in
Klingon. In Klingon the timestamp must be part of the beginning of the sentence
and must be before the object, if there is one (which also means before the
verb, whether there is an object or not). As you learn more about Klingon
grammar, you will see that there are also other elements that will be part of
the beginning of the sentence before the object.


### New verb prefixes

Next to {jI-} for «I …» and {bI-} for «you …» (for one person), you will learn
{Su-} for «you …» (for multiple people, also some times said as «you guys»,
«all of you», «you all», or «y’all»). These prefixes indicate that there is no
object.

You will sometimes be presented with an English sentence with the word «you»
and no other indication whether this is supposed to be singular or plural. In
such cases, Duolingo will usually accept either the Klingon version for
singular «you» or for plural «you». But watch carefully for other grammar or
context in the exercise that indicates whether the «you» might be singular or
plural.


### Pronouns

Pronouns can represent a noun, but you must include the appropriate prefix :
{maval maH} «we are smart»; {jIH cholegh SoH} «you see me».

The prefixes are required, the pronouns are not! Pronouns can be left off,
since the verb prefix shows what the subject and object are.

Pronouns are commonly used to emphasise the subject and/or object, for example,
{jIqet jIH ’ach bIyIt SoH} «*I* am running but *you* are walking».

When the null prefix is used for third person subjects and objects, pronouns
are sometimes used to clarify: {mara legh qoq ’ej ’oH tI’ ghaH} «The robot sees
Mara and she fixes it».


### {ghaH} vs {’oH}

Unlike English, Klingon does not use separate pronouns for male or female:
{ghaH} is used for all «beings capable of using language» (Klingons, humans,
etc.) regardless of whether they are male or female. It can be translated as
either «he» or «she» (or «him» or «her» as an object). To keep singular vs
plural clear, we do not accept «they» as a translation, but we encourage the
use of singular «they» in other contexts.

{’oH} «it» is used for other things: animals, plants, inanimate objects, etc.
Klingon is similar to English in that things are all «it» – there are no
feminine forks or masculine chairs.

There may occasionally be nouns, such as an android, for which it is difficult
to determine if it is a «being capable of language». There is no correct answer
for these and different people might use different pronouns.

This division into «beings capable of using language» and «everything else» is
also used in forming plurals and in possessive endings, which will be taught
later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 3. Section 1, Unit 3


## Interrogate Someone


### Negatives and questions

You will come across some adjectivals and verbs that are negative—he is not
handsome, I am not stupid—and/or are questions—is he handsome? are you smart?.

These are formed with the verb suffix {-’a’} for a yes/no question and the verb
suffix {-be’} for negative. The verb suffix {-’a’} is classified as a “type 9”
verb suffix and will always be the last suffix on a verb. The verb suffix
{-be’} is classified as a *rover*, and the nature of its “roving” will be
explained once you have learned more suffixes.

These suffixes can be added to any verb to turn it into a negative or a
question. For example, {jIQong} «I slept», {jIQongbe’} «I did not sleep»,
{jIQong’a’?} «did I sleep?»; {bIval} «you are smart», {bIvalbe’} «you are not
smart», {bIval’a’?} «are you smart»?

Even negative questions are possible: {valbe’’a’ torgh?} «Is Torg not smart?»,
{yItbe’’a’ mara?} «Didn’t Mara walk?» (Note that the {-’a’} is placed after the
{-be’} since it always comes last on the verb.)

Please note that the {-’a’} verb suffix is not used when there is a question
word such as «who», «what», «where», «when», «why», or «how». It is only used
to turn a statement into a yes/no question. Question words will be covered
later in this course, but you have already had a preview with questions like
{nuq ’oH ponglIj’e’} («What is it your name?»). Note that the suffix {-’a’} is
not used because that is not a yes/no question and instead uses a question
word.


### The words {HISlaH} and {ghobe’}

{HISlaH} means «yes» and {ghobe’} means «no». These words are primarily used to
answer yes/no questions. There are other words for refusal or acceptance, which
English often uses «yes» and «no» for, but Klingon uses {Qo’} (which is used to
express refusal, as in «I won’t!») and {lu’} (which is used to express
acceptance, as in «I will!»). Outside of this course, you may also see the word
{HIja’} which also means «yes» and is a direct synonym to {HISlaH} with no
different connotations. This course will only show you the word {HISlaH} for
«yes».

Note that unlike the English word «no», the words {ghobe’} and {Qo’} cannot be
used as determiners (as in «We have no bananas.»), nor as adverbs («I am no
better.»); they are strictly used as exclamations. For those other meanings,
Klingon requires you to negate the verb, instead, with the suffix {-be’}.


### Apostrophes and quotes

Remember that Klingon uses the apostrophe ’ as a letter.

It does not use the double-quote character ” as a letter—when you see what
might look like a double-quote in the middle of the word, it is actually two
apostrophes side by side.

For example, {maw’} means «to be crazy» or «he/she is crazy»; when you add the
question suffix {-’a’}, you get {maw’’a’?} «is he/she crazy?».


## Say When an Event Was


### Transitive verbs

This lesson practises some transitive verbs (ones that have an object).

Remember that the object comes {before} the verb and the subject goes {after}
it in a Klingon sentence.


### The {lu-} prefix

The lesson introduces a new prefix: {lu-} is used when the subject is «they»
and the object is «him», «her», or «it».

Remember that if the subject is «they» and the object is «them» or there is no
object, there is no prefix. Similarly if the subject is «he», «she», or «it»
and the object is «him», «her», or «it».

But the combination «they–him/her/it» needs a prefix: {lu-}.


### Noun-Noun

If there is no conjunction (like {je}) after nouns next to each other, the
effect is similar to possession: {mara pong} «Mara’s name»; {tlhIngan Hol} «a
Klingon’s language, the Klingon language».

To specify one person or thing that possesses another person or thing, the two
nouns (or noun phrases) are simply presented next to each other with the first
noun (or noun phrase) indicating the possessor and the second noun (or noun
phrase) indicating the posession:
<br>{HoD Duj} «the captain’s ship»
<br>{tlhIngan SoS} «the mother of the Klingon»


### Pronouns

Remember that pronouns can represent a noun, but you must include the
appropriate prefix : {maval maH} «we are smart»; {jIH cholegh SoH} «you see
me».

The prefixes are required, the pronouns are not! Pronouns can be left off,
since the verb prefix shows what the subject and object are.

Pronouns are commonly used to emphasise the subject and/or object, for example,
{jIqet jIH ’ach bIyIt SoH} «*I* am running but *you* are walking».

When the null prefix is used for third person subjects and objects, pronouns
are sometimes used to clarify: {mara legh qoq ’ej ’oH tI’ ghaH} «The robot sees
Mara and she fixes it».


### {SoH} vs {tlhIH}

Klingon distinguishes between «you» for speaking to one person and to several
people. «You» for one person is {SoH}; «you» for several people is {tlhIH}.
English sentences that use «you» are often ambiguous – they could be talking to
one person or several – but Klingon sentences are clear.

There is no distinction for formality or politeness. You would address any one
person, from the admiral of the fleet to your own younger sibling, as {SoH}.


### {chaH} vs {bIH}

Remember that {ghaH} is used for all «beings capable of using language»
(Klingons, humans, etc.) and {’oH} «it» is used for other things: animals,
plants, inanimate objects, etc. Klingon makes the same distinctions in the
plural. {chaH} is used for a group of beings capable of language and {bIH} for
a group of things (inanimate objects, animals, etc.). A mixed group will most
likely use {chaH bIH je}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 4. Section 1, Unit 4


## Make Basic Sentences

In grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one
the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of
verbs by means of *prefixes*.

The most important verb prefixes at the beginning of the course are:

<ul>
  <li>{jI-} = «I (subject), no object»
  <li>{bI-} = «you (subject), no object»—for one person
  <li>{vI-} = «I (subject), him/her/it/them» (object)
  <li>{Da-} = «you (subject), him/her/it/them (object)»—for one person
</ul>


### Verb and Noun suffixes

Meaning is added to Klingon words through use of syllables added to the front
or ends of words. Syllables added to the beginnings of words are called
prefixes and in Klingon indicate who is doing a particular verb and who that
action is done to.

Suffixes are added to the ends of words and occasionally you will encounter a
word with more than one suffix. Klingon linguists categorize these suffixes
according to which ones cannot occur together and what order they must occur
in. Verbs have 10 suffix types and generally only one suffix can occur from
each type, but if you have one from each type, plus a prefix, you would have a
very complicated verb!

Nouns have 5 suffix classes and you can only have one suffix of each type.
Klingon nouns can still get pretty complicated even with only 5 suffixes.

The types of the suffixes are numbered because they may only occur in the order
of their numbers. A type 1 suffix must always occur before a type 4 suffix.
This course will not be quizing you on the suffix types and it attempts to
teach you the proper order through drilling and familiarity rather than through
memorizing the types. None the less, we will generally mention the suffix type
in the Tips and Notes, in case you find it helpful or want to make a note of
it.


### Plurals

English plurals are a good example of using suffixes. In English an «-s» or an
«-es» is generally added to the end of the noun to make it plural. Klingon
plurals are formed in a similar fashion to the English method of forming
plurals. In Klingon a {-pu’}, {-Du’}, or {-mey} is added to the end of the
noun. These are the type 2 noun suffixes.

Nearly all Klingon nouns belong to one of three groups, depending on which type
2 noun suffix they use to form their plural:

<ul>
  <li>Beings capable of using language have a plural in {-pu’}
  <li>Body parts have a plural in {-Du’}
  <li>Everything else (including inanimate objects, robots, and animals) have a plural in {-mey}.
</ul>

There are only a handful of exceptions where nouns have completely separate
plurals, a bit like English «person»/«people».

In this lesson, you will come across some nouns that refer to beings capable of
using language: «man, woman, child». These therefore form their plural in
{-pu’}:

<table border=1 style="width:1px;white-space:nowrap">
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan=2>Singular</th>
<th colspan=2>Plural</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Klingon</th>
<th>English</th>
<th>Klingon</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{be’}</td>
<td>«woman»</td>
<td>{be’pu’}</td>
<td>«women»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{loD}</td>
<td>«man»</td>
<td>{loDpu’}</td>
<td>«men»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{puq}</td>
<td>«child»</td>
<td>{puqpu’}</td>
<td>«children»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Plural suffixes in Klingon are optional and can be left off. A noun without one
of these suffixes might still be plural. In the following units, you may come
across sentences where there is no plural suffix and only the nearby grammar
tells you that a noun must be plural.


### Joining two sentences with «and»

In the previous skills you learned that nouns are joined with {je}—remember
that it comes *after* the two nouns, as in {torgh mara je} «Torg and Mara».

To join two sentences with «and» a different word is used: {’ej}. This word is
placed *between* the sentences. For example, «I run» ({jIqet}) + «I jump»
({jISup}) can become «I run and I jump» ({jIqet ’ej jISup}).

{’ej} is only for joining sentences or verb phrases together, not nouns—you
cannot say «torgh ’ej mara», for example.


## Ask and Answer Questions


### Adjectives

Klingon does not have adjectives as a separate class of words; instead, it has
verbs which mean things such as «be handsome», «be smart», or «be big».

A sentence such as {val torgh} «Torg is smart» has the same grammar (verb +
subject) as {yaj torgh} «Torg understands», even though one sentence has an
adjective in English and the other an active verb.

Note that the English translation includes the connecting word «is» when you
use an adjective, but the Klingon translation just connects the subject
directly to the verb without using any sort of connecting word. As verbs, these
Klingon words already contain the «is» in their definitions like «be smart».

If, on the other hand, such a verb is used after a noun, it acts like an
attributive adjective: for example, from {Duj} «a ship» and {tIn} «big», we can
make {Duj tIn} «a big ship», and from {qach} «a building» and {’IH}
«beautiful», we can make {qach ’IH} «a beautiful building».

This can’t be interpreted as object + verb word order, because such verbs can’t
take an object—they can’t mean «it bigs the ship» or «it beautifuls the
building».

Compare again:
<br>{tIn Duj} «the ship is big»
<br>{Duj tIn} «the big ship»
<br>{’IH qach} «the building is beautiful»
<br>{qach ’IH} «the beautiful building»

## Make Sentences


### Suffixes {-’egh} and {-chuq}

This lesson introduces the type 1 verb suffixes.

The suffixes taught here indicate that the subjects of the verb somehow affect
themselves or each other.

{-’egh} indicates that the subject of the verb affects itself (or the subjects
affect themselves). For example, from {legh} (see), one could form {legh’egh
torgh} «Torg sees himself» or {legh’egh puqpu’} «the children see themselves»
(perhaps in a mirror).

{-chuq} indicates that the subjects of the verb affect each other. It only
makes sense if the subject is plural: «we, you, they». For example, {leghchuq
puqpu’} would mean «the children see each other»—that is, each child sees
another child.

In more technical terms, the suffix {-’egh} makes a verb
[*reflexive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_verb), while the suffix
{-chuq} makes it
[*reciprocal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_%28grammar%29).


### Plurals

As you have already seen, forming plurals is about as easy as in English—where
the basic rule is “just add «-s».” You may also remember that in Klingon, the
plural ending depends on whether the noun is a being capable of language or a
body part.

Beings capable of language take {-pu’} ({tlhIngan} «a Klingon», {tlhInganpu’}
«Klingons»).

Body parts take {-Du’} (and will be introduced later).

Everything else takes {-mey} ({nagh} «a rock», {naghmey} «rocks»).

Note that Klingons do not generally consider robots (no matter how smart or
independent) to qualify as «beings capable of language». Thus robots usually
(and in this course, always) use the plural suffix {-mey}: one {qoq}, several
{qoqmey}.

(If you, the one taking this course, are a language-using robot, we apologize
for any perceived slight this simplification may inflict.)

Plural suffixes are optional in Klingon, so «the Klingons» could be translated
as {tlhInganpu’} but also as {tlhIngan}.


### The special case of {mang}

The word {mang} «soldier» is introduced in this skill and as a being capable of
language uses the plural {mangpu’}. A note should be made that this is not the
simple plural it appears to be. There is a separate word, {negh} which is used
to refer to a group of «soldiers» as a whole. The plural word {mangpu’} has an
implication that you are talking about each individual soldier in the group.
Thus {mangpu’} might be translated as «each of the soldiers». For purposes of
this lesson the simple plural «soldiers» will also be accepted.


### Some more names

While you’ll still see «Torg» (male) and «Mara» (female) in the course, this
unit also introduces a few more names for variety.

A few of these are female: {beylana}, {ghIrIlqa’}, {luqara’} («B’Elanna»,
«Grilka», «Lukara»)

Most of them are male: {DuraS}, {ghawran}, {martaq}, {mogh}, {molor},
{moratlh}, {qeylIS, wo’rIv} («Duras», «Gowron», «Martok», «Mogh», «Molor»,
«Morath», «Kahless», «Worf»).

More names will come later in the “People” skill.


## Use Prefixes

This lesson introduces some new verb prefixes and verb suffixes, as well as
some more noun suffixes and the use of timestamps.


### Verb suffix {-laH} «can»

The type 5 verb suffix {-laH} indicates «can» or «able to».

For example, it makes the difference between {tlhIngan Hol vIjatlh} «I speak
Klingon» and {tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhlaH} «I can speak Klingon».


### Verb suffix {-be’} «not»

In an earlier unit we introduced the very useful verb suffix {-be’}, which
means «not». You may remember that this suffix is classified as a *rover*.
Unlike suffix types 1-9, some of the rovers can actually be placed in different
orders and change the meaning of the sentence slightly based on where they
occur.

The *rover* suffix {-be’} comes after the verb portion which it negates.

So {tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhlaHbe’} means «I cannot speak Klingon» (the {-be’}
negates the {-laH}), while {tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhbe’laH} would mean «I am able
to not speak Klingon» (the {-be’} negates the {vIjatlh} to make «I do not
speak», and then {-laH} turns that into «I can not-speak» or «I am able not to
speak»).

The other feature of some of the rovers is that they can appear multiple times,
thus negating multiple parts of the verb construction. {jIjatlhbe’laHbe’} would
mean, «I cannot not speak,» or, «I am not able to not speak.» (I know humans
like that, but Klingons like that are much more rare.)

Most verbs have only one or two suffixes at a time, and the correct order of
suffixes will soon become second nature from seeing the most frequent
combinations.


### Noun suffix {-mey}

This unit more fully introduces the type 2 noun suffix {-mey}, which forms the
plural of many nouns (the ones that are neither beings capable of language nor
body parts).

In Klingon, plural suffixes are optional—both {qach} and {qachmey} can be used
for «buildings».

Since it is clearer to use a plural suffix when there is more than one of
something, these early units in the course usually use them even though they
are optional. As you advance, sometimes we will show you sentences where only
the verb prefix or other context indicates that a noun is plural.


### More verb prefixes

You’ve already come across what are probably the most common verb prefixes:
{jI-}, {vI-}, {bI-}, {Da-}, {ma-}, {Su-}, and no prefix at all (sometimes
called the “null” prefix).

This unit introduces some new verb prefixes for combinations of subjects and
objects:

<table border=1 style="width:1px;white-space:nowrap">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prefix</th>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Object</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{qa-}</td>
<td>«I»</td>
<td>«you (singular)»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{Sa-}</td>
<td>«I»</td>
<td>«you (plural)»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{cho-}</td>
<td>«you (singular)»</td>
<td>«me»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{ju-}</td>
<td>«you (singular)»</td>
<td>«us»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{pI-}</td>
<td>«we»</td>
<td>«you (singular)»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{wI-}</td>
<td>«we»</td>
<td>«him, her, it»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{DI-}</td>
<td>«we»</td>
<td>«them»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{re-}</td>
<td>«we»</td>
<td>«you (plural)»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{tu-}</td>
<td>«you (plural)»</td>
<td>«me»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{ che-}</td>
<td>«you (plural)»</td>
<td>«us»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{bo-}</td>
<td>«you (plural)»</td>
<td>«him, her, it, them»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Pay special attention to the fact that when the subject is «we», there are
separate prefixes {wI-} and {DI-} depending on whether the third-person object
is singular (him, her, it) or plural (them)—unlike when the subject is «I»
({vI-} for both singular and plural third person subjects) or «you (singular)»
({Da-} for both singular and plural third person subjects) or «you (plural)»
({bo-} for both singular and plural third person subjects). Though this is a
constructed language, there are some irregularities like this that appear to
make it resemble a natural language.

Some of these prefixes are more frequent then others, especially the ones with
an object of «him, her, it» and/or «them», so you’ll see a fair bit of {bo-} in
this course and some {wI-} and {DI-}, and it pays to get those three down.

The others are a bit rarer, though {cho-} and {qa-} (you do something to me, or
I do something to you) are perhaps a bit more common than the others.

### To be or not to be

Klingon does not have a verb «to be». Instead, pronouns help to fill that role.

{jIH} means «I» or «me» but also means «I am» in sentences such as {tlhIngan
jIH} «I am a Klingon».

{ghaH} means «he», «she», «him», or «her» and also means «he is» or «she is» in
sentences such as {tlhIngan ghaH} «He is a Klingon» or «She is a Klingon».

To specify who the «he», «she», or «it» is, Klingon uses pronouns in
combination with a type 5 noun suffix {-’e’}. «Torg is a Klingon» is {tlhIngan
ghaH torgh’e’}, and «The men are Klingons» is {tlhInganpu’ chaH loDpu’’e’}.

The type 5 noun suffix {-’e’} will be covered in more detail later. For now,
please only use it where it is grammatically required—this means only in
sentences where a pronoun is used for «to be».


### Using verbs adjectivally and “to be”

Using a verb that can be used adjectivally for a statement, the verb includes
«to be» in the verb – you do not use a pronoun as «to be» for this: {val jagh}
(«The enemy is smart»). A pronoun may still be used to represent the subject –
{val ghaH} «she is smart», but we consider «is» to be part of {val} rather than
part of {ghaH}.

With a verb as an adjective following the noun it describes there is no «to be»
in the English translation. If you want to use such a noun phrase as the topic
in a pronoun as «to be» sentence, the {-’e’} suffix goes on the end of the
whole noun phrase (appearing to attach to the verb).

Compare:

<ul>
  <li>{val tlhIngan SuvwI’} «The Klingon warrior is smart.»
  <li>{val ghaH} «She is smart.»
  <li>{SuvwI’ val} «the smart warrior»
  <li>{tlhIngan ghaH SuvwI’ val’e’} «The smart warrior is a Klingon.»
</ul>


### This, that, these, those

«This, these» and «that, those» use type 4 noun suffixes: {-vam} and {-vetlh},
respectively: {Ha’DIbaHvam} «this animal», {Ha’DIbaHmeyvetlh} «those animals».

Whether «this» or «these» is appropriate as a translation of {-vam} depends on
whether the noun is singular or plural; similarly with «that» or «those» for
{-vetlh}.

These type 4 suffixes come after the type 2 plural suffix and {-’e’} would come
last as a type 5 suffix.


### Chasing forest sarks

A {Sargh} «sark» is a Klingon riding animal. The phrase, «chasing forest sarks»
is an idiom for “doing something complex and difficult.”


## Describe What You Sense


### More prefixes

This lesson teaches and practises some more verb prefixes which combine subject
and object:

<ul>
  <li>{mu-}: indicates that the subject is «he, she, it, they» and the object is «me»
  <li>{Du-}: indicates that the subject is «he, she, it» and the object is «you» (one person)
  <li>{nI-}: indicates that the subject is «they» and the object is «you» (one person)
  <li>{nu-}: indicates that the subject is «he, she, it, they» and the object is «us»
  <li>{lI-}: indicates that the subject is «he, she, it, they» and the object is «you» (several people)
</ul>

For example,

<ul>
  <li>{mulegh tlhInganpu’} «the Klingons see me» ({legh} «see»)
  <li>{mughov mara} «Mara recognizes me» ({ghov} «recognize»)
  <li>{DuQoy torgh} «Torg hears you» ({Qoy} «hear»)
  <li>{nISaH tera’nganpu’} «Terrans care about you» ({SaH} «care about»)
  <li>{lISuj vay’} «someone disturbs you all» ({Suj} «disturb», {vay’} «someone, something»)
  <li>{lIvoq be’pu’} «the women trust you all» ({voq} «trust»)
</ul>

Pay special attention to the fact that when the object is «you (singular)»,
there are separate prefixes {Du-} and {nI-} depending on whether the
third-person subject is singular (he, she, it) or plural (they)—unlike when the
object is «me» (always {mu-}) or «us» (always {nu-}) or «you (plural)» (always
{lI-}). Though this is a constructed language, there are some irregularities
like this that appear to make it resemble a natural language.


### Explicit Objects and Subjects

The prefix system allows both the object and subject to be indicated on the
verb itself and because of the specificity of the prefixes, it is often not
necessary to specifically state the object and subject with additional explicit
objects and subjects. However, if you do want to explicitly state who or what
the object or subject is, to make the sentence even more specific or for
emphasis, you simply put the name, noun, or pronoun before the verb (if the
object) or after the verb (if the subject).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

((zrajm has added stuff below here))


# 7. Section 1, Unit 7


## Use pronouns

<div>[#Vocabulary-2] Vocabulary 2 <small title="4452 bytes // 1588656565">4 · 2020-05-05</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Vocabulary-2/practice"></a></div>


### Verb suffix {-qu’}

This suffix is used to intensify a verb or another verb suffix.

You have seen previously, in this course, that other verb suffixes have type
numbers and must occur in a specific order following their type number. You
have also learned how to use the {-be’} suffix, which is classified as a
*rover* and can be placed in different locations to negate specific parts of
the verb. This {-qu’} suffix is also a *rover* and can occur directly after the
verb or after another suffix. When it occurs directly after the verb it is used
to emphasize the action or state of the verb itself.

Most often, it’s used on adjectival verbs to give a meaning like «very …» or
«really …» or «extremely …»: For example, {valqu’ SuvwI’} could be translated
as, «The warrior is very smart,» and, {yoHqu’ SuvwI’ valqu’} could be
translated as «The very smart warrior is really brave.»

Note that «really» is being used in these sentences to intensify the following
word and not necessarily to imply the truthfulness of the statement (there are
suffixes for that, but you’ll learn them in another unit).

When the suffix {-qu’} occurs after another verb suffix, it tends to emphasize
the meaning of that specific suffix, though officially it is emphasizing the
meaning of the whole word before it. For instance:
<br>{nIQoylaH} would mean, «They can hear you,»
<br>{nIQoyqu’laH} would mean, «They can really hear you,»
<br>and {nIQoylaHqu’} would mean, «They are really able hear you.»

As with {-be’}, the suffix {-qu’} can be used multiple times in the same verb
construction (to emphasize multiple different things). It is possible to say
something like, {nIQoyqu’laHqu’} («They are really able to really hear you.»).


### Demonstratives

You have already learned how to use the noun type 4 suffixes {-vam} «this» and
{-vetlh} «that». In English we use something called *demonstrative adjectives*
to accomplish this same thing. Similarly to how the Klingon suffixes attach to
the ends of the nouns they are “demonstrating,” these English *demonstrative
adjectives* must be placed before the nouns that they are demonstrating:
<br>{tajvam} «this knife»
<br>{tajvetlh} «that knife»

English also has something called *demonstrative pronouns* which can
*demonstrate* a noun by taking the place of the noun and not attaching to
anything:
<br>«This is a knife.»
<br>«That is sharp.»

Klingon does not have anything like a *demonstrative pronoun*. There is no way
to directly and literally translate such an English sentence. We must come up
with similar Klingon sentences that have the same sort of idea, even though
they are not exactly the same.

We are not going to go through all the possible methods here. We are just going
to demonstrate one simple method. While the Klingon pronoun {’oH} is a very
close and direct translation of the English word «it», you can use it where an
English speaker might use a *demonstrative pronoun*.

An English speaker might hold out a knife in his hand and say, «This is a
knife.» A Klingon holding out the knife and wanting to demonstrate what it is
would say, {taj ’oH.} (Note that this sentence is using the pronoun {’oH} as if
it were a verb meaning «it is» or «this is».)

An English speaker might point to the knife on the counter and say, «That is
sharp.» A Klingon pointing to the knife and wanting to demonstrate that it is
sharp could say, {jej ’oH}. (Note that {jej} is the verb «to be sharp» and
{’oH} is just acting as a simple pronoun here.)

Other third-person pronouns can be used in a similar method:
<br>{tajmey bIH} «These are knives.»
<br>{tlhIngan ghaH} «That is a Klingon.»
<br>{Humanpu’ chaH} «Those are Humans.»

You will find some exercises in this unit which include English sentences that
have *demonstrative pronouns*. We have included those sentences to give you a
chance to practice using the regular Klingon third-person pronouns in place of
the missing *demonstrative pronouns*.


## Discuss locations

<div>[#Locations-and-locatives] Locations and locatives <small title="5824 bytes // 1574145698">6 · 2019-11-19</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Locations-and-locatives/practice"></a></div>

In this unit, you will learn to speak about locations: being in a place or
going to or from a place. You will also learn to specify a currently ongoing
action.


### {-Daq}

The type 5 noun suffix {-Daq} is a generic locative—depending on context, it
can mean «at», «in», «on», «by», «to». A noun with {-Daq} would normally come
before the object of the sentence.

Depending on the verb, you may not need {-Daq}; some verbs have destinations or
locations *built in* to them and the destination or location is treated as an
object. Though in English we say that one would «go to» somewhere, Klingon does
not use {-Daq} because the verb {jaH} already includes the idea of «to» when
used with an object.

The word {nuqDaq} is usually translated as «where» and is placed into the same
position that the location would go if it were a statement. Even with verbs
that have movement *built in* and would not normally have {-Daq} added to the
destination, {nuqDaq} is used to ask «where». Since this is a question word,
the interrogative verb suffix {-’a’} is *not* used.


### {-vo’}

The type 5 noun suffix {-vo’} means «from» and is used to specify a starting
point or origin.

As both are type 5 noun suffixes, you may not use both {-Daq} and {-vo’} on the
same noun. They can be used with other suffixes, such as plurals, {-vam}, or
{-vetlh}. When used with other suffixes, the type 5 noun suffixes always go
last.

When using {-Daq} or {-vo’} on a noun + adjectival verb, the type 5 suffixes
(but not others) will go at the end of the entire phrase, appearing to attach
to the verb: {loDpu’ wochvo’} «from the tall men».


### {-taH}

The type 7 verb suffix {-taH} is used for continuous or ongoing actions. Its
meaning is very similar to that of the English -ing in «I am running».

Since Klingon doesn’t have tense, {jIqettaH} can mean «I am running» or can
mean «I was running» or «I will be running»—the {-taH} only shows that it is,
was, or will be an ongoing action.


### {-lI’}

The type 7 verb suffix {-lI’} is similar to {-taH} and also identifies an
ongoing action; however, it also implies that the action is heading towards a
specific end or goal.

{tera’ vIjaHlI’} (with {jaH} «go (to)») could be translated as «I am on my way
to the Earth»—with the suffix {-lI’} implying that the going is not only
ongoing but that you are making progress towards a known end point (when you
reach the Earth, you will stop).

As both are type 7 verb suffixes, you may not use {-taH} and {-lI’} on the same
verb. They *can*, however, be used with other suffixe types.


### To be «in», «at», «on» or «by» a place

As noted before, pronouns help to fill the role of the verb «to be» in Klingon.
This is also true with locations, such as, {monDaq ’oH} «It is in the capital.»

As with other «to be» sentences, if you want to explicitly state the subject
when using a pronoun as the verb «to be», you have to use the noun suffix
{-’e’}. {yuQDaq ’oH veng’e’} «The city is on the planet.»


### {-taH} with pronouns

Klingon often uses {-taH} in combination with a pronoun and a location to
indicate a temporary, but currently ongoing presence—for example, {Qo’noSDaq
ghaHtaH mara’e’} «Mara is on Kronos» (the Klingons’ home world); a bit more
literally, «As for Mara, she is being on Kronos».


### {Sum} and {Hop}

The adjectives {Sum} and {Hop} mean «(be) near» and «(be) far», respectively.

On their own, they usually mean that something is near the speaker or far from
the speaker. For example, {Sum mara} would mean «Mara is close (to me)».

If you want to say that something or someone is close to (or far from) someone
else, you can use {-Daq} to make the reference point explicit: {SoHDaq Sum
mara} (literally, «at you, Mara is close») would mean «Mara is near you», while
{SoHDaq Hop mara} (literally, «at you, Mara is far») would mean «Mara is far
away from you».


### Above and below

Klingon doesn’t have prepositions such as «above» or «below» or «next to».

Instead, there are nouns that mean «area above», «area below», «area next to»,
and so on, and things are described as being in ({-Daq}) those areas.

The area nouns that you will encounter in this lesson, together with a rough
preposition equivalent in English, are:

<ul>
<li>{bIngDaq} «in the area below» = under
<li>{DungDaq} «in the area above or overhead» = over
<li>{jojDaq} «in the area between» = between, among
<li>{retlhDaq} «in the area beside or next to» = next to
<li>{tlhopDaq} «in the area in front» = in front of
<li>{’emDaq} «in the area behind» = behind
</ul>

{nagh retlhDaq ghaHtaH torgh’e’} «Torg is next to the rock» literally means
something like «Torg is in the rock’s area-beside».

Note that in standard Klingon, the way to say something like «in front of me»
{jIH tlhopDaq} and «behind you» is {SoH ’emDaq}. Later you will learn
possessive suffixes (like «my» and «your»), but they are not used with these
area nouns.

# 8. Section 1, Unit 8


## Indicate timing

<div>[#Aspect-suffixes] Aspect suffixes <small title="3993 bytes // 1570254499">2 · 2019-10-05</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Aspect-suffixes/practice"></a></div>


### Aspect suffixes: Revision and extension

This lesson gives some more practice and revision on the type 7 verbal aspect
suffixes that you have met before ({-taH} and {-lI’}) and introduces two more:
{-pu’} and {-ta’}.

You will then know all four of Klingon’s type 7 verbal aspect suffixes.

Of these four, {-taH} and {-pu’} are more general and so are more commonly
used. {-lI’} and {-ta’} have more specific meanings and are only used when you
want to emphasize those meanings.


#### {-taH} and {-lI’}

As you have seen before, these show continuous aspect—marking a given action as
ongoing or continuous.

{-lI’} specifically implies that action is headed towards some defined goal or
end, while {-taH} is neutral in this respect. (It neither implies nor denies an
endpoint, it just notes that the action is currently ongoing.)

Sometimes, «is in the process of (doing something)» may be an equivalent for
{-lI’}. Sometimes, a different verb might convey the goal-oriented action, e.g.
{tlha’taH} «he is following him» versus {tlha’lI’} «he is pursuing him».


#### {-pu’} and {-ta’}

These verb suffixes mark perfective aspect: that a given action is completed.
They are commonly translated into the English perfect tenses: «has done», «had
done», «will have done».

{-pu’} is the more general and neutral suffix, and does not specify or deny any
intent to have done the action. The action may have been intentional, it may
have been accidental, or it may have been beyond our control.

(Don’t confuse this one with the identical *noun* suffix {-pu’} that indicates
the plural of beings capable of using language.)

On the other hand, the verb suffix {-ta’}, implies that the action was
undertaken intentionally and was accomplished—that one set out to do the action
and was successful in the action.

Sometimes the simplest way to represent {-ta’} in English is to add, «has
accomplished (doing something)» or, «has successfully (done something)». There
are also some verbs which include a notion of intent in the verb and naturally
lend themselves to using the {-ta’} suffix, like «has defected», «has won», or
«has executed». These verbs are not usually used when the action was not
deliberately taken.

Note that with {-taH}/{-lI’}, the difference was one of progressing towards an
end point, but with {-pu’}/{-ta’} the end point has already been reached and
the difference is instead a question of intent.


### Adverbs: {bong} and {chIch}

This unit introduces the adverbs {bong} «accidentally» and {chIch}
«intentionally».

Adverbs and adverbial expressions (such as expressions of time—«yesterday»,
«next month», «on Tuesday» etc.) always come at the beginning in Klingon.

Note that putting {chIch} at the beginning of the sentence or {-ta’} on the
verb of the sentence creates a very similar meaning, but perhaps with a
slightly different focus on intentionality vs. completion:
<br>{chIch qoq vItI’pu’} «I have intentionally fixed the robot.»
<br>{qoq vItI’ta’} «I have accomplished fixing the robot.»

Klingon grammarians do not consider it incorrect to include both the adverb
{chIch} and the suffix {-ta’} and do not consider it to be overly repetitive.
Such sentences are rare, but it is perfectly fine to say, {chIch qoq vItI’ta’}
«I have intentionally accomplished fixing the robot.»

A later unit (“Adv”) will provide more adverbs for you to practice; this is a
kind of preview.


## Give commands

<div>[#Imperatives] Imperatives <small title="4475 bytes // 1570254499">4 · 2019-10-05</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Imperatives/practice"></a></div>


### Imperatives / Command forms

How to get people to do what you want them to? You ask them to nicely!

Klingons are direct, so they don’t waste time on words such as «please». That
means that a command such as {yIngu’’egh}! «Identify yourself!» is not
necessarily considered rude; it could be the equivalent of «Excuse me, could
you tell me who you are, please?». A Klingon might consider such an
uneccessarily complicated and roundabout question as rude and would see the
directness of {yIngu’’egh}! as much more polite.


### {yI-}

The most important verbal prefix for imperatives is {yI-}.

It’s used on all imperatives that have a grammatical object of «him, her, it»,
no matter how many people you are speaking to. It’s also used on imperatives
without a grammatical object if you are speaking to one person.

For example, {mara yISam!} «Find Mara!» could be directed to one person or to
several, but {yI’Ij!} «Listen!» could only be addressed to one person.


### {pe-}

If you wanted to issue a command without a grammatical object to several
people, you would use the prefix {pe-} instead, e.g. {pe’Ij!} «Listen!».

Note that the only time it matters how many people you are giving a command to
is when there is no grammatical object. For all commands with a grammatical
object, the same prefix is used whether you are giving the command to one
person or to many. However, if there is no grammatical object, then you use
{yI-} when giving the command to one person and {pe-} when giving the command
to multiple people.


### {tI-}

The prefix {tI-} is used whenever the object of the command is third person
plural («them»), e.g. {tera’nganpu’ tIngu’!} «Identify the Terrans!». The same
prefix is used whether you are speaking to one person or many of them.


### {HI-}, {gho-}

{HI-} is used when the object is «me» and {gho-} is used when the object is
«us», e.g. {HIvoq!} «Trust me!» or {ghovuv!} «Respect us!». These are also the
same regardless of whether you are speaking to one person or many.


### {-Qo’} with imperatives

We have previously learned that statements are negated by using the negative
verb suffix {-be’}. However, for imperatives, a different suffix is used for
negation. Negative imperatives use the suffix {-Qo’}. For example, {HIHot!}
«Touch me!» can be turned into {HIHotQo’!} «Don’t touch me!»

The {-Qo’} suffix is officially grouped with the rover verb suffixs, but it
doesn’t actually rove at all. Even if there are more than one suffix on the
imperative verb, the {-Qo’} suffix will occur last.

There are some circumstances where specific suffixes would follow the {-Qo’}
suffix, but they do not occur with imperatives. You will learn about those
later in the course. For now, if you are negating a command, place the {-Qo’}
suffix at the end of the verb, after any other suffixes.


### {wej}

The adverb {wej} appears at the beginning of the sentence and makes the
sentence a negative sentence meaning, «not yet». It is not used with negative
suffixes like, {-be’} and {-Qo’} and can be used with statements, questions,
and commands. For instance:
<br>{wej jagh wISuvpu’.} «We have not yet fought the enemy.»
<br>{wej paq DalaD’a’?} «Didn’t you read the book yet?»
<br>{wej qoq yItI’!} «Don’t fix the robot yet!»


### State verbs (“adjectivals”)

When you form the command form of a verb that describes a state, rather than an
action (the kind of Klingon verb that in English would often be an adjective,
such as {yoH} «be brave» or {matlh} «be loyal»), you need the suffixes {-’egh}
and {-moH}, e.g. {yIyoH’eghmoH!} «be brave!», literally «make yourself brave!»,
or {pematlh’eghmoH!} «be loyal!», literally «make yourselves loyal!».

The suffix {-moH} is taught later on, so you will not see such commands with
state verbs in this unit. This is just a grammar preview.

# 9. Section 2, Unit 1


## Show disposition

<div>[#Volition-_-Predisposition] Volition / Predisposition <small title="3571 bytes // 1596197712">6 · 2020-07-31</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Volition-_-Predisposition/practice"></a></div>

This lesson introduces the type 2 verb suffixes, which indicate things such as
how much choice the subject has in performing the action of the verb or their
willingness or readiness to do so.


### {-nIS}

{-nIS} means «need»; sometimes «must» or «have to» can also be appropriate.
{maqetnIS} «we need to run (we must run, we have to run)»


### {-qang}

{-qang} means «willing» and indicates that the subject of the verb does not
mind taking a certain action under the circumstances and does so willingly:
{tera’ vIjaHqang} «I am willing to go to Earth».


### {-vIp}

{-vIp} means «afraid» and shows that the subject is afraid to do the given
action: {tlhIngan Soj SopvIp tera’ngan} «the earthling is afraid to eat the
Klingon food» ({Soj} «food», {Sop} «eat»).

You will rarely hear the {-vIp} suffix from a Klingon with a prefix indicating
that the subject is «I» or «we»—it’s a cultural taboo to indicate that the
speaker (or a group including the speaker) is afraid to do something.


### {-beH}

{-beH} means «ready» or «set up» and shows that the device acting as the
grammatical subject is in a state where it can perform the required action:
{labbeH} «it is ready to transmit (data)» ({lab} «transmit data»)


### {-rup}

{-rup} is similar to {-beH}, but is used with sentient subjects (this time, no
language use is necessary, so animals, for example, qualify); it means «ready»
or «prepared» and is used when the subject (a sentient being) is able to take
on a task because they are ready to do so: {qaleghrup} «I am ready to see you».


### Order of suffixes

With all of these suffixes, remember that the negative suffix {-be’} follows
the part of the word that is negated—this means that it’s important to look at
the order of suffixes in a word.

{laDvIpbe’} has {-be’} after {-vIp} and so means «he is not afraid to read it»
(he is {-vIpbe’} to {laD}), while {laDbe’vIp} has {-be’} after {laD} and so
means «he is afraid to not read it»; «he is afraid not to read it» (he is
{-vIp} to {laDbe’}).

Or as another example, {Duj wItI’nISbe’} has {-be’} after {-nIS} and so means
«we do not need to repair the ship; we do not have to repair the ship» while
{Duj wItI’be’nIS} has {-be’} after {tI’} and so means «we must not repair the
ship; we need to not repair the ship».

Note that only one type 2 verb suffix can be placed on a single verb. It is
impossible to use type 2 verb suffixes alone to indicate that someone is
«willing to be afraid to do something» or «willing to be ready to do
something». For these kinds of meanings much more complicated constructions,
probably consisting of multiple sentences, will need to be used.


### {wo’vaD}

In this unit, you will encounter the word {wo’vaD}. The {-vaD} suffix will be
explained in detail in a later unit, but for now, note that this word is not
used as the object or subject of a verb, but is instead placed before the OVS
structure to indicate that the action is done on behalf of the Empire.


## Describe hypotheticals

<div>[#if-…-then] if … then <small title="1638 bytes // 1570254499">3 · 2019-10-05</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/if-...-then/practice"></a></div>

To express the concept «if», Klingons attach a type 9 verb suffix on the end of
the verb: {-chugh}.

For example, from {bIyIt} «you walk», you can make {bIyItchugh} «if you walk».

As in English, the *if* clause can come before or after the *result* clause:

<ul>
<li>{bIDoy’chugh yIQong} «If you are tired, sleep!»
<li>{yIQong bIDoy’chugh} «Sleep, if you are tired!»
</ul>

Because of this, the exercises will often be strict in requiring that you
maintain the order of the clauses. When the *if* clause comes first in the
language presented to you, it must also come first in the translation.
Similarly, if the *result* clause comes first in the language presented to you,
it must also come first in the translation.

The result clause may start with {vaj} «then, so, thus, in that case»,
especially when the *if* clause comes first: e.g. {bIDoy’chugh vaj yIQong} «If
you are tired, then sleep!» It is more unusual, but not incorrect to see {vaj}
on the result clause when it comes first: {vaj yIQong bIDoy’chugh} «Then sleep,
if you are tired!» It is also common to see the two clauses side by side
without using {vaj} in the result clause.

This unit teaches *if* sentences with conditions that are considered real or
possible. Hypothetical or counterfactual sentences («If you were tired, you
would sleep», «If I had studied, I would have passed the test», or the like)
use a different structure which is not covered in this course.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 10. Section 2, Unit 2


## Talk about animals

<div>[#Animals] Animals <small title="2935 bytes // 1585260313">6 · 2020-03-27</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Animals/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces a number of Klingon animals and practices the {-mey}
plural suffix for animals and other things that are not body parts and are not
capable of using language.

This unit also introduces possessive suffixes.


### Possessive suffixes

Remember that to specify one person or thing that possesses another person or
thing, the two nouns (or noun phrases) are simply presented next to each other
with the first noun (or noun phrase) indicating the possessor and the second
noun (or noun phrase) indicating the possession:
<br>{HoD Duj} «the captain’s ship»
<br>{tlhIngan SoS} «the Klingon’s mother»

When you don’t want to list the specific possessor, but just want to refer to
them, English would use a possessive pronoun, such as «my», «your», «his»,
«their» etc.

In Klingon these relationships are marked with type 4 noun suffixes.

Klingon distinguishes here between possessions which are beings capable of
using languages (those which have their plural in {-pu’} and use pronouns
{ghaH} and {chaH}) from all other possessions (those which have their plural in
{-mey} or {-Du’} and use pronouns {’oH} and {bIH}).

If the possession is not a being or not capable of using language, such as an
inanimate object, an animal, a body part, etc., then the following possessive
suffixes are used:

<ul>
<li>{-wIj} «my»
<li>{-lIj} «your» (belonging to one person)
<li>{-Daj} «his, her, its»
<li>{-maj} «our»
<li>{-raj} «your» (belonging to several people)
<li>{-chaj} «their»
</ul>

If the possession is a being capable of using language (e.g. «my mother»),
some, but not all, of those endings end in a glottal stop {’} instead of a {j},
e.g. {-lI’} instead of {-lIj}. Those Endings are taught later, in the “Family
1” unit.

Since you have now learned many of the possessive suffixes, remember that the
possessive suffixes are not generally used with area nouns. In {ta’ Hol} we
don’t say {tlhopwIjDaq} or {’emlIjDaq} (though speakers from Sakrej region
would)—instead {ta’ Hol} speakers would use pronouns and say, {jIH tlhopDaq}
«in front of me» and {SoH ’emDaq} «behind you».


### Preview of {-bogh}

You will see the {-bogh} relative-clause verb suffix used in this Skill. It is
used here to mean, «thing that» as in {puvlaHbogh qoq} «a robot that can fly».
For now memorize these words as a unit and the specifics of how to use the
suffix will be taught in detail later on.


## Identify people

<div>[#People] People <small title="5740 bytes // 1584735407">5 · 2020-03-20</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/People/practice"></a></div>

In this skill, you will learn some words for talking about people. You have
already seen some examples such as {tlhIngan} «Klingon», {tera’ngan}
«Terran», {be’} «woman» and {loD} «man».

You will also be reviewing the type 2 plural noun suffix {-pu’}

You may remember that {-pu’} is a noun suffix that pluralizes nouns describing
«beings capable of using language». Including Klingons, Humans, Organians,
Vulcans, men and women, warriors and teachers, emperors and chancellors,
potentially even sentient robots (but not in this course).

Other plurals which you have already seen are:

<ul>
<li>{Body parts} Including hands and feet, arms and legs, bones and kidneys. The plural suffix for this category is {-Du’}.
<li>{Everything else} Including rocks and trees, plants and animals, shoes and starships, beams and waves. The plural suffix for this category is {-mey}.
</ul>

In this skill, we’ll be focusing on just the first of these suffixes, {-pu’}.
The others are practiced in other units of the course.

While the plural suffixes can make a sentence more clear, they are in fact
completely optional. The word {tlhIngan} can mean either «Klingon» or
«Klingons», whereas the word {tlhInganpu’} is explicitly plural and can only
mean «Klingons».

So, if you’re asked to translate the sentence «I see Klingons.», you can
respond with either:

<ul>
<li>{tlhInganpu’ vIlegh.} «I see Klingons.»
<br>or
<br>
<li>{tlhIngan vIlegh.} «I see one or more Klingons.»
</ul>

You can also sometimes distinguishing between singular and plural nouns based
on the use of the verb prefixes:

<ul>
<li>{SuvwI’ lulegh tera’ngan.} «The Terrans saw the warrior.» (The subject must be plural and the object must be singular because the {lu-} prefix must have a plural subject and singular object.)
<li>{torgh legh HoD.} «The captain saw Torg.» (Assuming there is only one Torg, the subject must be singular, otherwise the {lu-} suffix would have been used.)
<li>{nov legh yaSpu’.} «The officers saw the aliens.» (Since the subject is plural, the object must be plural, otherwise the {lu-} suffix would have been used.)
<li>{Dulegh tlhIngan.} «The Klingon saw you.» (The subject must be singular because the {Du-} prefix must have a singular subject.)
<li>{nIlegh loD.} «The men saw you.» (The subject must be plural because the {nI-} prefix must have a plural subject.)
<li>{be’ wIlegh.} «We saw the woman.» (The object must be singular because the {wI-} prefix must have a singular object.)
<li>{Human DIlegh.} «We saw the humans.» (The object must be plural because the {DI-} prefix must have a plural object.)
</ul>


### {quv} vs. {batlh}

Both of the *nouns* {quv} and {batlh} are usually represented by the same
English word «honor». In English we use the word «honor» for a few different
purposes, but Klingon distinguishes the personal accounting of «honor» that one
earns and separates it from the «honor» which we talk about as an internal,
philosophical concept of doing the right thing. As nouns, the official
descriptions state that {quv} is associated with «reputation, dignity, and
respect» and {batlh} is associated with «integrity, rectitude, scruples, and
principles».

Thus {quv} as a *verb* is usually translated as «be honored» and {batlh} as an
*adverb* is usually translated as «honorably» or «with honor». {quv} cannot be
used as an adverb and {batlh} cannot be used as a verb.


### More Klingon names

Starting from this lesson, you may also meet the following additional Klingons:

Female names—{’a’Setbur}, {be’etor}, {lurSa’}, {boqor}, {lurveng} («Azetbur»,
«B’Etor», «Lursa», «Bokor», «Lurveng»)

Male names—{cheng}, {DuraS}, {ghorqon}, {qarghan}, {qImpeq}, {toral},
{turghal}, {tlha’a} («Chang», «Duras», «Gorkon», «Kargan», «K’Mpec», «Toral»,
«Turgal», «Klaa»)

Miscellaneous names—{ghurlaq} («Gurlak»)

And a few non-Klingons: {qIrq} («Kirk», male); {pIqarD} («Picard», male);
{’elvIS} («Elvis», male).


### Captain Torg

Titles come after the name in Klingon, the opposite order to English. So,
«Captain Torg» becomes {torgh HoD}. Rarely this can cause confusion as the same
phrase can also mean «Torg’s captain.»


### {ra’wI’} «commanding officer»

The noun {ra’wI’} is actually made of a verb + suffix combination and you will
learn how to create such words later in this course. This is defined as «one
who commands» or «commander», though we must be careful not to confuse this
with the similar rank. Thus it is translated as «commanding officer» in this
course. Note that a {ra’wI’} does not have to be an officer and this is just
being used to differentiate from the rank. As a noun, {ra’wI’} can take all the
noun suffixes including the posessive suffix {-wI’}. At first the word
{ra’wI’wI’} «my commanding officer» may seem odd, but you will get used to
it.

# 11. Section 2, Unit 3


## Discuss body parts

<div>[#Body-parts] Body Parts 1 <small title="1947 bytes // 1570254499">2 · 2019-10-05</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Body-parts/practice"></a></div>

Body parts (eyes, hands, etc.) have a special plural in Klingon: they are
pluralised not with {-mey} or {-pu’} but with {-Du’}, e.g. {mInDu’} «eyes»,
{nItlhDu’} «fingers».

As always, the plural suffix is optional.

Except for the separate plural ending, they act grammatically like other
inanimate objects, e.g. using {’oH} «it» and {bIH} «them», rather than {ghaH}
«he/she» and {chaH} «them» and using the regular possessive endings (ending in
{j}) such as {-wIj} «my».

Cultural note: Klingons have built-in redundancy in their internal organs so
that if, for example, one liver should fail due to injury or disease, the other
one can keep on working. This means that many body parts for which humans have
only one, Klingons have in pairs.

Klingons also possess a body part that is not spoken about in polite company:
the {qIvon}, about which little is known among other races besides its name and
the fact that some (or perhaps all) Klingons seem to have more than one. The
{qIvon} is featured in some common Klingon phrases, but don’t expect to ever
get a Klingon to show you, or even tell you about, his {qIvonDu’} unless you
get to know him extremely well.

The saying {bIrchugh qIvon tuj ’Iw} literally translates as, «If the {qIvon} is
cold, the blood is hot,» but seems to mean something like, «Even when a Klingon
does not seem so, he is always ready for battle.»

The idiom {bel qIvon} is often used with kids and seems to refer to going to
the bathroom. One might ask a kid, {belHa’’a’ qIvonlIj}? («Is your {qIvon}
displeased?») or excuse themselves from the room with {qIvonwIj vIbelnISmoH}
(«I must please my {qIvon}.»).


## Describe objects

<div>[#Adjectives] Adjectives <small title="4006 bytes // 1676547420">5 · 2023-02-16</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Adjectives/practice"></a></div>

This unit teaches you some more verbs which can be used adjectivally. Remember
that, though these are adjectives in English, there is no such thing as an
adjective in Klingon and these are really verbs which can be used in a manner
resembling an adjective.

These verbs can be used both in a manner similar to an attributive adjective
describing a noun (in which case they come after the noun) or as a predicate
adjective (like «… is blue/old/brave/…») in which case they are normal verbs
and come before the subject without any connecting words (unlike English which
uses the connecting verb «is/are/be»).


### Old, new, and young

A pair of adjectives to pay special attention to is {ngo’} and {qan}, as these
both translate to «old» in English.

{ngo’} «old» is the opposite of {chu’} «new», while {qan} «old» is the opposite
of {Qup} «young».

So a book or a house can be {ngo’} but a person will be {qan}.


### Colors

Klingon has very few basic color names, so each color covers quite a broad part
of the spectrum of visible light.

Most straightforward are {chIS} «white» and {qIj} «black».

{Doq} covers colors in the red-orange-brown part of the spectrum. It might be
helpful to think of {Doq} as meaning «warm colored», though for translating
purposes we ask you to pick a specific color in the range.

{SuD} covers colors in the yellow-green-blue part of the spectrum. It might be
helpful to think of {SuD} as meaning «cool colored», though for translating
purposes, we, again, ask you to pick a specific color in the range.

There isn’t really a word for «purple» or «violet» in Klingon, perhaps because
Klingon eyes can’t perceive that color, though this is a controversial
assertion. Some non-Klingons use {Doq ’ej SuD} «blue and red».

Further color distinctions can be made either with additional adjectives such
as {wov} «light» and {Hurgh} «dark»; with the suffix {-qu’} «very, really»; or
by using similes. (For example, brown things are sometimes describes as {Qaj
wuS rur} «resembles kradge lips», in reference to the kradge, an animal
with—you guessed it—brown lips.)


### Placement of adjectives and suffixes

Remember that, in Klingon, verbs acting adjectivally to modify nouns come after
the nouns they modify, as in {tlhIngan woch} «a tall Klingon». In contrast,
when a noun is used to modify another noun, it comes before the noun it is
modifying, as in {tlhIngan Hol} «the Klingon language».

When using a noun phrase made up of two nouns as a location or as the topic of
a pronoun as «to be» sentence, the suffixes {-Daq} («in/at/on/by/to»), {-vo’}
(«from»), or {-’e’} (topic) go at the end of the phrase, which is the main
noun: {tlhIngan DujmeyDaq jIQuch} «I am happy on Klingon ships».

When using a noun phrase that is made up of a noun + adjectival verb as a
location or topic, such suffixes still go at the end of the phrase, which makes
them appear to attach to the verb: {Dujmey chu’Daq jIQuch} «I am happy on new
ships.»

Compare those two sentences to make sure you see the difference between using a
noun to modify another noun and using a verb to modify a noun:
<br>{tlhIngan DujmeyDaq jIQuch} «I am happy on Klingon ships».
<br>{Dujmey chu’Daq jIQuch} «I am happy on new ships.»

When using both kinds of modifiers, these type 5 noun suffixes will still go at
the end of the whole phrase, again appearing to attach to the verb: {tlhIngan
Dujmey chu’Daq jIQuch} «I am happy on new Klingon ships.»

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 12. Section 2, Unit 4


## Evaluate situations

<div>[#Adverbials] Adverbials <small title="1154 bytes // 1569405144">2 · 2019-09-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Adverbials/practice"></a></div>

This unit covers a range of adverbial words in Klingon. Official Klingon
grammar categorizes all the words that aren’t nouns or verbs as {chuvmey}
«leftovers». Thus these adverbial words are {chuvmey}.

Adverbials such as these modify or qualify a verb or sentence and may express a
relation of time, manner, cause, degree, etc. (e.g., «quickly», «on purpose»,
«forcefully», or «with honor»).

Adverbial words such as these usually stand at the beginning of a sentence in
Klingon—before the main Object-Verb-Subject part of the sentence. There are
some exceptions where other words might occur before the adverb and there are
also a couple adverbs that are exceptions in that they appear after the verb
instead of before it. These exceptions are not covered in this unit and all of
the adverbials presented in this unit will occur at the beginning of the
sentence.

There are a few qualifying ideas which are adverbs in English, but which occur
as a type of verb suffix in Klingon rather than as separate adverbial words.
These suffixes of qualification are taught in a separate unit.

# 13. Section 2, Unit 5


## Use numbers

<div>[#Numbers-0-100] Numbers 0-100 <small title="4911 bytes // 1676547420">6 · 2023-02-16</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Numbers-0-100/practice"></a></div>

Klingon numbers used to be based on threes rather than tens: counting went
«one», «two», «three»; 3 + 1, 3 + 2, 3 + 3; 2 × 3 + 1, 2 × 3 + 2, 2 × 3 + 3;
3 × 3 + 1, 3 × 3 + 2, 3 × 3 + 3, and then it got complicated.

However, fortunately for learners on Earth, the Klingon scientific community
has since created a number system based on ten, and this is the one we will be
teaching here.

(Cultural note: the first three number names {wa’, cha’, wej} were kept, and
the additional numbers {los, vagh, jav, Soch, chorgh, Hut} were borrowed from
the names of the fourth through ninth notes of the Klingon musical scale.)

Numbers higher than «nine» use a set of suffixes that attach only to numbers.

Unlike English, these number names are completely regular—as if we used
«onety», «twoty», «threety», «fourty», «fivety» etc. based on «one», «two»,
«three», «four», «five» plus a suffix «-ty» for «tens».

In Klingon, the suffixes are:

<ul>
<li>{-maH} for «tens» (e.g. {wa’maH} «10», {cha’maH} «20»)
<li>{-vatlh} for «hundreds» (e.g. {wejvatlh} «300», {loSvatlh} «400»)
<li>{-SaD} or {-SanID} for «thousands» (e.g. {vaghSaD} «5,000», {javSanID} «6,000»)—both suffixes are used about equally often and there is no known difference between them.
<li>{-netlh} for «tens of thousands» (e.g. {Sochnetlh} «70,000», {chorghnetlh} «80,000»)
<li>{-bIp} for «hundreds of thousands» (e.g. {HutbIp} «900,000»)
<li>{-’uy’} for «millions» (e.g. {wa’’uy’} «1,000,000»)
</ul>

Numbers in between are written with multiple words, e.g. {loSvatlh vaghmaH jav}
«456», {wa’SaD Soch} «1,007».

The word for «zero», as we have seen before, is {pagh}.

Numbers indicating how many of something there are come before the noun they
are counting: {wa’ paq} «one book».

As we have seen before, plural suffixes on nouns are optional; this is
particularly true after numbers, e.g. {loS puqpu’} or {loS puq} both mean «four
children».

Ordinal numbers are formed with the number suffix {-DIch}, e.g. {cha’maH
loSDIch} «twenty-fourth», {cha’DIch} «second». Ordinal numbers come after the
noun they are indicating: {Duj wa’maHDIch} «the tenth ship».

To count the number of repetitions of something, you can add the suffix {-logh}
to a number: {wa’logh} «once», {cha’logh} «twice», {javvatlhlogh} «six hundred
times». Repetitions act like adverbs and come at the front of the sentence
(i.e. before the OVS).


### The question word {’ar}

The word {’ar} means «how many?» or «how much?». This word follows the singular
form of the word that it is inquiring about. For example:

<ul>
<li>{nagh ’ar Daje’?} «How many rocks did you buy?»
<li>{nIm ’ar Daje’?} «How much milk did you buy?»
</ul>

If the noun that {’ar} is referring to can take a type 2 plural suffix, the
plural suffix should *not* be used, but the word should still be treated as
plural:
<br>{Duj ’ar DIghaj?} «How many ships do we have?»

If the noun that {’ar} is referring to does not normally take a type 2 plural
suffix, for instance mass nouns and inherently plural nouns, then the word
should be treated as singular:
<br>{bIQ ’ar wIghaj?} «How much water do we have?»

Remember that we do not use the interrogative verb suffix {-’a’} with question
words such as {’ar}. The interrogative verb suffix {-’a’} is only used to form
a yes/no question from a statement.


### {law’} and {puS}

In this unit you will also learn the words {law’} «be many» and {puS} «be few».
These are verbs and not actually numbers. They can be used as verbs to make
complete sentences:
<br>{law’ tlhIngan Duj} «The Klingon ships are many.» (or in English we might
be more likely to say it as, «There are many Klingon ships.»).
<br>{puS verengan yoH} «The brave Ferengi are few.» (or in English we might be
more likely to say it as, «There are few brave Ferengi.»)

These verbs can also be used in an adjectival manner by following a noun:
<br>{pawtaH tlhIngan Duj law’} «Many Klingon ships are arriving.»
<br>{yoH verengan puS} «A few Ferengi are brave.» (or in English we might be
more likely to say it as, «There are a few brave Ferengi.»)


## Talk about family

<div>[#Family-1] Family 1 <small title="5757 bytes // 1586183774">4 · 2020-04-06</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Family-1/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces possessive suffixes for beings capable of speech—for
example, «my father», «your sister», «her brother» etc.—as well as Klingon
kinship terms, i.e. names for various relatives.


### Possessive suffixes for beings capable of speech

<ul>
<li>{-wI’} «my»
<li>{-lI’} «your» (belonging to one person)
<li>{-Daj} «his, her, its»
<li>{-ma’} «our»
<li>{-ra’} «your» (belonging to several people)
<li>{-chaj} «their»
</ul>

Notice that, {-Daj} «his/her» and {-chaj} «their» are the same as for things
not capable of speech—the others differ by ending in {j} for inanimate objects
but in {’} for beings capable of speech.

Do not mix them up in the company of Klingons and refer, for example, to
{puqlIj} «your child» as if it were an object.

Note that these suffixes are not used when you are explicitly indicating the
possessor with a name or a noun. For instance, «the captain’s mother» would be
{HoD SoS}. The suffixes are only used to refer to the possessor with generic
pronouns, like English «your», «his», «their», etc. So «his mother» would be
{SoSDaj}.


### Kinship terms

The Klingon kinship term system is quite a bit more specific than in English,
which often merges similar relatives together (e.g. «cousin» can refer to any
grandchild of any of your grandparents that is not your brother or sister, and
an «uncle» can be related to you by blood or by marriage). On the other hand,
Klingon makes no distinction between cousins and nephews/nieces, unlike
English.


### Terms for lineal relatives

Names for lineal relatives (direct ancestors or descendants) map pretty neatly
to English, since English has separate words for pretty much all of these:

<ul>
<li>{vavnI’, SoSnI’} «grandfather, grandmother»
<li>{vav, SoS} «father, mother»
<li>{loDnal, be’nal} «husband, wife»
<li>{loDnI’, be’nI’} «brother, sister»
<li>{puq; puqloD, puqbe’} «child; son, daughter»
<li>{puqnI’; puqnI’loD, puqnI’be’} «grandchild; grandson, granddaughter»
</ul>

This unit also includes the form {vavoy} «daddy», which is an affectionate
term, usually for one’s own daddy. The suffix {-oy} in that word will be
introduced properly and used more widely in the unit “Grandeur” later on.


### Terms for collateral relatives

Names for «aunts», «uncles», «cousins», «nephews», and «nieces» are more
specific than in English-speakers of languages such as Chinese, Swedish, or
Turkish may be more at home here (though Klingon makes no distinction between
elder and younger siblings).


#### Parents’ generation, father’s side (paternal uncles and aunts)

Your «father’s brother» is your {tennuS}, and your «{tennuS}’s wife» is your
{’e’mamnal}.

Your «father’s sister» is your {’e’mam}, and your «{’e’mam}’s husband» is your
{tennuSnal}.


#### Parents’ generation, mother’s side (maternal uncles and aunts)

Your «mother’s brother» is your {’IrneH} and your «{’IrneH}’s wife» is your
{me’nal}.

Your «mother’s sister» is your {me’} and your «{me’}s husband» is your
{’IrneHnal}.


#### Your and your children’s generations (cousins, nephews, and nieces)

Your cousins are divided into «parallel cousins» (children of father’s
brother/mother’s sister, i.e. of the sibling of the same gender as your parent)
and «cross cousins» (children of father’s sister/mother’s brother).

Your «parallel cousins» are your {tey’pu’}; they are {tey’loD} if male and
{tey’be’} if female. Your «cross cousins» are your {lorpu’}; they are {lorloD}
if male and {lorbe’} if female. Klingons tend to be closer to their parallel
cousins than to their cross cousins.

These same names are also used for your nephews and nieces—parallel nephews and
nieces (if you’re a man, then your brother’s children; if you’re a woman, then
your sister’s children) are {tey’pu’} as well, while children of your sibling
of the opposite gender as you are your {lorpu’}.

Groups of {tey’pu’} and {lorpu’} together are your {vInpu’} «cousins, nephews
and nieces (in general)»; one of them may also be called a {vIn} «cousin»,
«nephew», or «niece».

More «distant cousins» (second cousin once removed, grandnephew, etc.) are
{yurpu’}.


#### More general terms

An {’e’nal} is an «in-law» in general: someone who married into your family,
whether father-in-law, sister-in-law, uncle-in-law or whatever.

A {tuqnIgh} is a «member of your house» ({tuq} «house»), i.e. your extended
family unit or clan.

Finally, there are three verbs for «to marry»: what a man does is {Saw}, while
what a woman does is {nay}. These specific verbs are usually preferred, but if
the situation does not allow you to be specific you can say {tlhogh}, which can
be used by either partner for «to marry».


### {quvmoH} «to honor»

You have previously seen {quv} («to be honored»), but one can also honor
another with {quvmoH} «to honor». The {-moH} ending is a suffix that you will
learn later in the course. For now just treat them as separate but related
verbs.

# 14. Section 2, Unit 6


## Discuss food and drink

<div>[#Food-and-drink] Food and drink <small title="2065 bytes // 1603955510">2 · 2020-10-29</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Food-and-drink/practice"></a></div>

Various terms for Klingon food and drink.

{Soj} is anything you can consume, so it’s wider than “food” since it also
includes drinks.

{Sop} is «to eat solid food», {tlhutlh} «to drink liquids», and {’ep} is a verb
for «to eat {chatlh}».

{chatlh} is a kind of «soup» or «stew», in between solid and liquid (though
usually with less liquid than an English «soup»). English speakers usually «eat
soup» while Turkish speakers «drink soup»; Klingons {’ep} their {chatlh}, using
neither the term {Sop} nor {tlhutlh} for the process. It’s probably best
translated into English as «eat», but only applies to such soups or stews.

{naH} is a generic word for the edible parts of plants and is used to refer to
both what English would call «fruits» and «vegetables». Two specific {naH}
unique to {Qo’noS}, but similar in some ways to produce which is common on
Earth, are the {peb’ot}, which is very similar to an Earth cucumber, and the
{na’ran}, which has some distinct similarities to an Earth orange.

One note on an irregular plural: a {jengva’} is a «plate» (for eating from),
but several of them are not {jengva’mey}, but rather {ngop} «plates».

That word is treated as a singular noun; for example, «Where are the plates?»
is {nuqDaq ’oH ngop’e’?} rather than {nuqDaq bIH ngop’e’?}, and «Wash the
plates!» is {ngop yISay’moH!} rather than {ngop tISay’moH!}.

(English speakers may be reminded of the word «dishware» and German speakers
may be reminded of the word «Geschirr», which similarly are singular nouns
applying to multiple dishes, though not necessarily only plates.)

There are about half a dozen nouns in Klingon with such an irregular plural,
most of which are not taught in this course.


## Talk about clothing

<div>[#Clothing-and-armor] Clothing and armor <small title="907 bytes // 1581380170">3 · 2020-02-11</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Clothing-and-armor/practice"></a></div>

Another vocabulary lesson, with words devoted to clothing and armor.

The word {paSlogh} «socks» is intereresting because it seems to refer to socks
in general and is always translated into English as a plural, but always
treated in Klingon as a singular. This kind of noun is often referred to as
*inherently plural*. It might help to think of the word as meaning something
more like «hosiery». Klingon does have a word which can refer to a specific,
individual solitary sock: {tu’mI’}. It would be very unusual to use the word
{tu’mI’} with a type 2 plural noun suffix and {paSlogh} would usually be used
when refering to more than one sock. However, following the pattern of some
other inherently plural nouns, one might be able to use {tu’mI’mey} to imply
that there are “socks scattered all about.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 15. Section 2, Unit 7


## Discuss changes

<div>[#Change] Change <small title="943 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Change/practice"></a></div>

This unit is focussed mostly on grammar, namely, the type 3 verb suffixes
{-choH} and {-qa’}.

{-choH} indicates a change in state; typical translations are «begin to, start
to» or «become», but sometimes also «fall» (e.g. {QongchoH} «start to sleep» =
«fall asleep»).

{-qa’} indicates that an action had taken place, stopped, then resumed again.
«Again» is often a translation for {-qa’}; sometimes, «back», «re-», «resume»,
or «repeat».

Note that since both of those suffixes are type 3, they fit into the same
“slot” after a verb and cannot both attach to the same verb at the same
time—you can use either {-qa’} or {-choH} but not both at once.

So there’s no {-qa’choH} or {-choHqa’} for «start to … again»; just use {-qa’}
in this case.


## Ask questions

<div>[#Question-words] Question words <small title="2224 bytes // 1612073658">2 · 2021-01-31</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Question-words/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces the questions words of Klingon:

<ul>
<li>{nuq?} «what?»
<li>{’Iv?} «who?» or «whom?»
<li>{nuqDaq?} «where?»
<li>{ghorgh?} «when?»
<li>{chay’?} «how?»
<li>{qatlh?} «why?»
</ul>

Please note that even though you are asking a question, you do *not* use the
interrogative verb suffix {-’a’} with these question words. The {-’a’} verb
suffix is only used to turn a statement into a yes/no question and is not used
with question words like these.

This unit also introduces the question tag {qar’a’?}. This literally means, «is
it accurate?», but it can also act as a general question tag—English
translations might include «doesn’t he? aren’t we? isn’t that so? eh? innit?
right?» depending on the sentence it is attached to, the level of formality,
and where you come from.


### A few notes on the question pronouns {nuq} and {’Iv}:

Just as the difference between {ghaH} and {’oH}, {’Iv} is used for all «beings
capable of using language» (Klingons, humans, etc.) and can be translated as
«who» or «whom» and {nuq} «what» is used for other things: animals, plants,
inanimate objects, etc.

As pronouns, they can act like a noun and they would be placed in the same
position as the answer would occur in the sentence:
<br>{Sop ’Iv?} «Who ate it?»
<br>{nuq Sop?} «What did he eat?»

Also like pronouns, they can act like a verb to form a «to be» question (the
same way that {’oH}, {ghaH}, etc. form «to be» sentences).

So you may see sentences like {’Iv ghaH tlhInganvetlh’e’?} «Who is that
Klingon?» or {nuq ’oH ponglIj’e’?} «What is your name» with {’Iv} and {nuq}
acting like nouns, and you may also see sentences like {tlhInganvetlh ’Iv?} or
{ponglIj nuq?} with {’Iv} and {nuq} acting like verbs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 16. Section 2, Unit 8


## Indicate recipients

<div>[#Beneficiaries] Beneficiaries <small title="4766 bytes // 1566677152">4 · 2019-08-24</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Beneficiaries/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces the noun suffix {-vaD}.

It indicates the beneficiary of an action (for whom something is done?) and is
often translated as «for» or «to». Note that “beneficiary” is a linguistic term
and the action is not always to the benefit of the beneficiary. If you give a
bomb to someone, they are the beneficiary, even though the bomb does not
necessarily benefit them.

Note that the word “action” is used a couple times in the above paragraph. This
suffix connects a noun to a verb when that noun is neither the subject nor the
direct object. An example of it’s use is that the recipient of verbs of
speaking or giving would be marked as the beneficiary.

Another example would be its use with {pong} «to name, to call» to mark the
beneficiary—the person or thing given a certain name—e.g. {SoHvaD mara vIpong}
«I will call you Mara» (in the sense of: I will use the name Mara for you). The
English translation does not appear to use a preposition, but Klingon does use
{-vaD} to indicate the “beneficiary” or “recipient” of the naming.


### Placement of {-vaD}

A noun marked with {-vaD} cannot be used as an object or subject and will occur
before the OVS structure of the sentence. Since this suffix marks the syntactic
role of the noun or noun phrase, like {-Daq}, {-vo’}, and {-’e’}, you may not
combine any of these suffixes together and you can only choose one syntactic
role for the noun or noun phrase.

You can, however, combine the syntactic markers with other suffixes like
plurals and possessives. If a noun has multiple suffixes, {-vaD} will always be
the last.

If {-vaD} (like the other syntactic markers) is placed on a noun phrase created
using noun + adjectival verb, this suffix moves to the end of the phrase, thus
appearing to attach to the verb: {jupwI’ QIpvaD paq vInob} «I will give the
book to my stupid friend.»


### The prefix trick

In English, we can say either «I gave the book to him» or the shorter «I gave
him the book», without «to»; the sentences mean the same thing and the word
order makes it clear what is meant.

Klingon also allows one to abbreviate sentences that would use {-vaD} in some
cases. The recipient has to be first or second person (to me, to you, to us)
and there must either be a third-person direct object (a singular or plural
noun or one of the pronouns «him, her, it, them»), or there is no object stated
and the verb cannot take a person as a direct object.

To abbreviate a sentence like this, the verb prefix will show the subject as
usual, but will show the *indirect* object (the beneficiary/recipient) rather
than the *direct* object.

For example, {cho-} is the verb prefix for: subject = «you (one person)», object
= «me». If we say {paq chonob}, it will mean «you gave me a book»: the same
thing as {jIHvaD paq Danob} «you gave a book to me».

In the shorter version, {paq chonob}, it is clear that «me» is not the direct
object (the thing given) because an explicit object {paq} is present.

In the longer version, {jIHvaD paq Danob}, the verb prefix {Da-} («subject =
you, object = it») agrees more straightforwardly with the direct object.

Similarly, {qoqmey ghonob!} «Give us the robots!» would be understood the same
way as {maHvaD qoqmey tInob!} «Give the robots to us!»—{gho-} «you!–us
(imperative/command)» will be understood with «us» as the indirect object
because the direct object {qoqmey} is present.

As an example of a verb that cannot take a person as a direct object, {jatlh}
«to say, to speak» can only take things such as languages, speeches, or
sentences as direct objects. Thus {qajatlh} cannot mean *«I speak you» but has
to mean «I speak to you».

This abbreviated way of forming sentences using the verb prefixes in a
different way rather than using {-vaD} is also known as “the prefix trick”.


### Noun-noun

There is sometimes a temptation to use the {-vaD} suffix to relate two nouns
when English uses the word «for», as in, «a message for the captain». Klingon
does not use the {-vaD} suffix for this kind of connection and in the vast
majority of cases, you are better off using the genitive noun-noun
construction: {HoD QIn} «a message of the the captain» or «the captain’s
message».


## Identify a cause

<div>[#Cause] Cause <small title="3593 bytes // 1676547420">3 · 2023-02-16</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Cause/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces the suffixes {-moH} and {-Ha’}.


### {-moH}

{-moH} is a type 4 verb suffix—in fact, it is the only type 4 verb suffix that
we know of. {-moH} is used to form causatives; this feature is also present in
several other languages, such as Esperanto’s «-ig-».

For example, from {poS} «to be open» one can form a new verb {poSmoH} «to cause
to be open, to make open = to open». From {Sop} «to eat» one can form a new
verb {SopmoH} «to cause to eat» = «to feed». From {ghoj} «to learn» one can
form a new verb {ghojmoH} «to cause to learn» = «to teach».

If the root verb does not take an object, then the subject of the root verb
simply becomes the object of the causative verb:

<ul>
<li>{poS Qorwagh} «the window is open»
<li>{Qorwagh poSmoH mara} «Mara opens the window»
</ul>

If the root verb can take an object, then there are several possibilities,
depending on whether you want to name both the original subject and object, or
just one of them:

<ul>
<li>{tlhIngan Hol ghoj tera’ngan} «The Terran learns Klingon»
<li>{tlhIngan Hol ghojmoH lurveng} «Lurveng teaches Klingon» (original object stays object)
<li>{tera’ngan ghojmoH lurveng} «Lurveng teaches the Terran» (original subject becomes object)
<li>{tera’nganvaD tlhIngan Hol ghojmoH lurveng} «Lurveng teaches Klingon to the Terran» (original subject becomes beneficiary; original object stays object)
</ul>

This means that something like {puq SopmoH torgh} «Torg feeds the child» can be
ambiguous between «Torg feeds the child (to the targ)» or «Torg feeds the child
(with pie)».

{targhvaD puq SopmoH torgh} and {puqvaD chab SopmoH torgh} are clear.


#### {-’eghmoH} in commands

As you may remember from the “Imperatives” unit, verbs of quality (verbs that
describe a state or quality, such as «be hungry», «be tired», «be brave», «be
loyal», rather than an action, such as «run», «walk», «fight», «eat», «drink»)
require {-’eghmoH} in the imperative or command form.

For example, «be brave!» would be {yIyoH’eghmoH!} to one person (literally,
«cause yourself to be brave!») and {peyoH’eghmoH!} to several people
(literally, «cause yourselves to be brave!»).

Since {-’egh} is a type 1 verb suffix and {-moH} is a type 4 verb suffix, any
type 2 or 3 suffixes would come between them, but would otherwise not change
the usage or meaning.


### {-Ha’}

The verb suffix {-Ha’} implies un-doing something that you did or mis-doing
something, doing it wrongly. Sometimes the meaning is also simply the opposite
of the basic verb.

For example, from {yaj} «understand» we get {yajHa’} «misunderstand»; from
{meS} «to tie (a knot)» {meSHa’} «to untie (a knot)», and from {par} «to
dislike» {parHa’} «to like».

{-Ha’} is officially classified as {lengwI’} (a rover) by Klingon linguists,
but, in actuality, it doesn’t rove the way {-be’} and {-qu’} do. When {Ha’} is
used it always comes immediately after the verb, including even before any Type
1 verb suffixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 17. Section 2, Unit 9


## Give an explanation

<div>[#Cause-2] Cause 2 <small title="4572 bytes // 1615586884">5 · 2021-03-13</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Cause-2/practice"></a></div>

This unit teaches the suffix {-mo’} and another use of the verb suffix {-Qo’}
which we have seen before.


### {-mo’}

The suffix {-mo’} means «because (of)» and appears as either a noun suffix or a
verb suffix. Klingon linguists treat these as two separate suffixes, one type 5
noun suffix and one type 9 verb suffix. Most of the suffixes are unique and the
few that do look similar have completely different uses and meanings ({-pu’} on
a noun is a plural and on a verb indicates it is perfective, {-lI’} on a noun
is a possessive and on a verb indicates it is «in progress»). Grammatically we
separate the noun suffix {-mo’} from the verb suffix {-mo’}, but they both
occur as the last suffix on a word (whether a noun or a verb) and they both
mean «because» (when we use this noun suffix we often add «of» to the English
translation).

As an example of using the noun suffix {-mo’}, from {vavwI’} «my father» we can
form {vavwI’mo’} «because of my father». As an example of using the verb suffix
{-mo’}, from {jIghung} «I am hungry» we can form {jIghungmo’} «because I am
hungry».

If a noun is followed by an adjectival verb, then the {-mo’} ending goes on the
adjectival verb; for example, {vavwI’ HoSmo’} «because of my strong father». Be
careful to note that {HoS} cannot have a grammatical object and so has to be
acting adjectivally here. Thus this cannot be the verb suffix {-mo’} and must
be the noun suffix {-mo’} even though it appears to be on a verb.

Whether being used on a noun or a verb, {-mo’} is always the last suffix. A
noun marked with {-mo’} (or a noun phrase consisting of noun + adjectival
verb + {-mo’}) must appear before the object-verb-subject structure of the
sentence. When {-mo’} is placed on the verb of a complete clause, the whole
{-mo’} clause may be placed before or after the main clause of which it is
indicating the cause. Be careful to pay attention to the order of the verb
clauses. Since they can be in either order in both languages, we require you to
translate them in the same order as presented.


### {-Qo’}

The verb suffix {-Qo’} has come up on imperatives (command forms) before, where
it turns the command into a negative: «Don’t …!». This can also be interpreted
as «Refuse to …!»

When the verb is not imperative, the {-Qo’} suffix can also be used to mean
«refuse».

For example, from {qagh Sop tera’ngan} «The Terran eats gagh» we get {qagh
SopQo’ tera’ngan} «The Terran refuses to eat gagh».

On non-imperative verbs the {-Qo’} suffix is often translated simply with the
words «will not» or «won’t» (only as an indication of refusal and not as a
reference to future tense). So {qagh SopQo’ tera’ngan} can also be translated
as «The Terran won’t eat gagh.»

There is a subtle difference here from regular negation with {-be’}. Compare:
<br>{qagh Sopbe’ tera’ngan} «The Terran doesn’t eat gagh.»
<br>{qagh SopQo’ tera’ngan} «The Terran won’t eat gagh.»

You may remember, from the Imperatives unit, that the {-Qo’} suffix is
officially classified as a rover, but does not actually rove. In that unit you
were told that the {-Qo’} suffix would always come last, but there were
exceptions. These exceptions occur when using {-Qo’} on non-imperative
sentences.

Any type 9 syntactic verb suffix will always occur after the {-Qo’} suffix. The
type 9 syntactic verb suffixes that you have learned in this or prior units are
the {-’a’} «interrogative» verb suffix, the {-chugh} «if» verb suffix, and the
{-mo’} «because» verb suffix presented above. Thus to ask, «Does the Terran
refuse to eat gagh?» a Klingon might ask, {qagh SopQo’’a’ tera’ngan?} Or to
say, «If you won’t buy, then you will die,» a Klingon might say, {bIje’Qo’chugh
vaj bIHegh}. Or, the customer having already failed to make a purchase, the
Klingon might say, {bIje’pu’Qo’mo’ DaH bIHegh} («Because you have refused to
buy, now you will die.»)


## Discuss space bodies

<div>[#Space-exploration] Space exploration <small title="831 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Space-exploration/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces various words related to space, stars, planets, etc.

It also includes the word {tu’lu’}.

The grammar behind this will be taught more explicitly later, so for now, just
learn {X tu’lu’} as «there is an X», and {Y-mey (lu)tu’lu’} as «there are
(some) Ys».

Technically, the verb form should be {lutu’lu’} if there are many Ys, but many
Klingons just say {tu’lu’} whether there is just one thing or there are many
things. It’s perhaps a bit like «whom» in English—«Whom did you see?» is the
conservative form and is technically correct, but very many native speakers
would simply say «Who did you see?».

This course generally uses just {tu’lu’} whether there is just one object or
many.

This unit is all about comparing.


### {rur}

The first lesson uses the verb {rur} to say that something resembles or is
similar to something else.

For example, we might say {vavwI’ rur torgh} «Torg resembles my father».

This verb is also used to ascribe qualities to someone by comparing them to
someone or something else that has that quality.

For example, {quv torgh; qeylIS rur} literally means «Torg is honored; he
resembles Kahless» but idiomatically means «Torg is as honored as Kahless»—the
implied comparison is that Torg resembles Kahless in that quality we have just
mentioned, namely being honored.


### «Bigger/smaller/cheaper/… than»

The next few lessons use the *X Q {law’} Y Q {puS}* pattern, which needs a bit
more explanation.

To say that one thing has a quality in a greater degree than another thing,
English uses the «-er» ending («bigger», «smaller», «better», …) or the word
«more» («more expensive», «more interesting», «more powerful») together with
the word «than».

Klingon does this quite differently.

To say something such as «My father is stronger than your brother», Klingons
say {vavwI’ HoS law’ loDnI’lI’ HoS puS}.

This might be interpreted, somewhat literally though ungrammatically in
English, as «my father’s strong is many; your brother’s strong is few» or «my
father has much strong, your brother has few strong».

The adjectival verb (here: {HoS}) has to be named twice—once with the {law’}
«many» and once with the {puS} «few». When used in this kind of construction,
the adjectival verb never takes a prefix, and pronouns may be used for the
nouns which are being compared, for example: {jIH HoS law’ SoH HoS puS} for «I
am stronger than you.»

In the hints for translating Klingon to English, combinations such as {HoS
law’} are usually glossed as «stronger» and {puS} is glossed as «than», but you
can’t just say {vavwI’ HoS law’ puS loDnI’lI’} for «my father is stronger than
your brother»—remember to put the adjectives after the nouns, to use them
twice, and to follow one by {law’} and the other by {puS}.

To negate such a comparison, negate both {law’} and {puS}, e.g. {vavwI’ HoS
law’be’ loDnI’lI’ HoS puSbe’} «my father is not stronger than your brother».

*As a side note, because “A Q {law’} B Q {puS}” structure is so distinctive,
Klingons may use other pairs of antonyms than {law’}/{puS} such as {HoS}/{puj},
{pIv}/{rop}, {Daj}/{qetlh}, {ghegh}/{Hab}, {Qatlh}/{ngeD}. This course will
only accept {law’}/{puS}, though.*


### Most

The comparative structure mentioned above can be turned into a superlative one
(Torg is the bravest, etc.) by using {Hoch} «everyone, everything» as the
second part of the comparison: {torgh yoH law’ Hoch yoH puS} «Torg is the
bravest» (more literally, «Torg is braver than everyone»).

If you want to specify the group from among whom Torg is the bravest, you can
use the topic marker to do so: {tlhInganpu’’e’ torgh yoH law’ Hoch yoH puS} «As
for Klingons: Torg is the bravest» = «Torg is the bravest Klingon, Torg is the
bravest of the Klingons».


## Tell time

<div>[#What-time-is-it] What time is it? <small title="844 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/What-time-is-it/practice"></a></div>

This unit teaches you one way to tell time and to say at what time something
happens.

It works for full hours.

The question is {’arlogh Qoylu’pu’?} and can be translated as «What time is
it?»

The literal translation is «How many times has it been heard?», with «it»
originally referring to some traditional bell or chime, presumably.

Saying when something happens in the future or had happened in the past can be
done with {xxx-DI’ yyy-logh Qoylu’pu’} «xxx will happen/happened at yyy
o’clock», or literally, «when xxx happens/happened, it will have been heard/had
been heard yyy times».

For example, {mapawDI’ loSlogh Qoylu’pu’} «We will arrive at four o’clock / We
arrived at four o’clock» (literally: «when we arrived, it had been heard four
times»).

## Say when an event was

<div>[#Time-from-now-and-time-ago] Time from now and time ago <small title="4711 bytes // 1585041624">2 · 2020-03-24</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Time-from-now-and-time-ago/practice"></a></div>

This unit teaches you how to describe some things that happened in the past or
will happen in the future with words such as «the day before yesterday» or
«three months from now». It also introduces the days of the week.


### The Klingon day

The basic Klingon word for a day is {jaj}. In it’s strictest use, this refers
to one complete planetary rotation from one dawn to the next dawn. The Klingon
day can be divided into {pem} «daytime» followed by {ram} «night».


#### Today

You may notice that the word {jaj} appears in the timestamp {DaHjaj} «today».
It is also used in the word {jajvam} «this day». {jajvam} seems never to be
used as a timestamp, but is frequently used to refer to «today» in sentences as
the subject, object, or topic of the sentence. For instance in the famous
Klingon aphorism, {Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam!} «Today is a good day to die!»

{DaHjaj} can also be used as the subject, object, or topic of a sentence, but
it is rare to see it that way. {jajvam} is mostly used for that purpose and
{DaHjaj} is usually just used as a timestamp.


### Time ago and time from now

Klingon expresses notions such as «x days ago» or «y days from now» with
special syllables combined with a preceeding number and do not use the word
{jaj}.

Similar syllables are used for months and years.

You will see the number and the time syllable written together as if the
syllable was a number suffix, but you also may sometimes see them written as
two words with a space between.


#### Time ago

<ul>
<li>{-Hu’} = days ago ({wa’Hu’} «yesterday», {cha’Hu’} «the day before yesterday», {wejHu’} «three days ago», {loSHu’} «four days ago», …)
<li>{-wen} = months ago
<li>{-ben} = years ago
</ul>


#### Time from now

<ul>
<li>{-leS} = days from now ({wa’leS} «tomorrow», {cha’leS} «the day after tomorrow», {wejleS} «three days from now», {loSleS} «four days from now», …)
<li>{-waQ} = months from now
<li>{-nem} = years from now
</ul>

*People who like mnemonics may find it useful to remember {waQ} and {wen} as
«months from now», «months ago» because the moon “waxes” and “wanes.”)*


#### How old are you?

The suffix {-ben} «years ago» is also used when inquiring about someone’s age.

When asking someone how old they are, Klingons ask how many years ago they were
born: {ben ’ar bIboghpu’?}

And the answer might be {wa’maH chorghben jIboghpu’} «I was born eighteen years
ago = I am eighteen years old».

It is standard to use the {-pu’} syllable even though the English does not
include «has/had/will have» and so we allow answers that do not include them
for these phrases.


#### Other time periods

For other time periods that have no specific suffixes, such as minutes from now
or weeks ago, you can use {ret} «time period ago» and {pIq} «time period from
now».

For example, {wa’ Hogh ret} is «one week ago» and {wa’maH tup pIq} is «ten
minutes from now»—literally, «one week’s time-period-ago» and «ten minutes’
time-period-from-now».


### Days of the week

The days of the week in the Gregorian calendar commonly used on Earth are as
follows:

<ul>
<li>{DaSjaj} «Monday»
<li>{povjaj} «Tuesday»
<li>{ghItlhjaj} «Wednesday»
<li>{loghjaj} «Thursday»
<li>{buqjaj} «Friday»
<li>{ghInjaj; lojmItjaj} «Saturday»
<li>{jaj wa’} «Sunday»
</ul>

There are two words for Saturday. There’s no difference in meaning between
them. The longer one {lojmItjaj} tends to be used on formal occasions, but
otherwise, both are used about equally frequently.

The days {DaSjaj} through {ghInjaj/lojmItjaj} are Klingon weekday names and are
used in the Klingons’ six-day week.

When Klingons encounter calendars with more than six weekdays, they simply
number the remaining days and call them «Day One», «Day Two», «Day Three» etc.

Thus our Sunday gets called {jaj wa’}, literally, «Day One».


## Discuss time relations

<div>[#Time-suffixes] Time suffixes <small title="788 bytes // 1569559898">2 · 2019-09-27</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Time-suffixes/practice"></a></div>

This unit teaches some type 9 syntactic verb suffixes that indicate when
something happened or will happen.

{-pa’} means «before», {-DI’} means «when» or «as soon as», and {-taHvIS} means
«while».

{-taHvIS} is really a compound of {-taH}, the continuous-aspect suffix which we
have seen before, and {-vIS}, which conveys the «while» meaning and which is
always used together with {-taH}.

For example, {bISoppa’ ghopDu’ tISay’moH!} «Before you eat» {(bISoppa’)}«, wash
your hands» {(ghopDu’ tISay’moH)}«!»

This can also be said as {ghopDu’ tISay’moH bISoppa’!} «Wash your hands before
you eat!»

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 20. Section 2, Unit 12


## Describe purposes

<div>[#Purpose] Purpose <small title="937 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Purpose/practice"></a></div>

This unit introduces the verb suffix {-meH} which is used for purpose
clauses—«in order to (do something)» or «so that (something)».

Together with the verb {lo’} «use», this also gives us a way to phrase things
that would use the preposition «with» in English.

For example, «he cut the fruit with a knife» can be rephrased as «to cut the
fruit, he used a knife» {naH pe’meH taj lo’}. (Note that the purpose clause
*must* come *before* the other clause—the word order {*taj lo’ naH pe’meH} is
not possible.)

The subject of the verb with the {-meH} prefix does not need to be the same as
the subject of the verb in the main clause: for example, one can say
{SulaDlaHmeH, Qorwagh vIpoSmoH} «I open the window» {(Qorwagh vIpoSmoH)} «so
that you all can read» {(SulaDlaHmeH)}«.»


## Use unknown subjects

<div>[#Indefinite-subject] Indefinite subject <small title="4922 bytes // 1585836076">2 · 2020-04-02</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Indefinite-subject/practice"></a></div>

This unit is all about the type 5 verb suffix {-lu’}, called the «indefinite
subject» suffix.


### Indefinite Subject

This suffix indicates that the subject or actor is unknown, indefinite,
irrelevant, or general. We often indicate this in English by using generic
subjects like, «one», «someone», or «they».

For example, {loD choplu’pu’} would mean «someone has bitten the man», «they
have bitten the man», or «one has bitten the man».


### Prefixes

The use of verbal prefixes in connection with this suffix is a bit unusual.

The prefix is chosen as if the patient or “sufferer” of the verb were the
subject and the object were «he, she, it».

For example, «it bites you» (when speaking to one person) is {Duchop}, but when
using {-lu’} to say, «one bites you», {Du-} is not used but instead {Da-}—the
form used for «you (one person) do something to it»: {Dachoplu’} «one bites
you; someone or something bites you; they bite you».

Thus, we have:

<ul>
<li>{vI…lu’} = «one … me»
<li>{Da…lu’} = «one … you»
<li>{…lu’} = «one … him/her/it»
<li>{wI…lu’} = «one … us»
<li>{bo…lu’} = «one … you all»
<li>{lu…lu’} = «one … them»
</ul>


### Passive voice

To avoid expressing who is doing the action, English sometimes use the passive
voice, such as «the man was bitten». The English passive voice is used to
emphasize what would normally be the object of a sentence by placing it in the
subject position. You can add the preposition «by» to indicate who actually did
the action («the man was bitten by the targ»), but still emphasize that you are
talking about a man being bitten and the targ is incidental. However, if you
leave the preposition off, then it becomes a type of indefinite subject. If all
I say is «the man was bitten» then who did the biting is left indefinite.

As we indicated earlier, {loD choplu’pu’} would mean «someone has bitten the
man», but it can also be translated into the English passive voice, «the man
was bitten.»

Note that in the passive voice, English reverses the position of the subject
and object:
<br>The targ bites the man.
<br>{loD chop targh}
<br>The man is bitten by the targ.

When using the English passive voice, the ones doing the action and having the
action done to them now appear in the same order as the Klingon sentence. When
doing the exercises this can be somewhat confusing because if you are given the
passive voice in an English sentence, the receiver of the action will appear
first and the word order will match the Klingon, instead of being reversed like
you would normally expect.

Also note, however, that the use of the Klingon prefixes *does* seem to reverse
and also now seems to match the English passive voice:

<ul>
<li>{vIHo’lu’} = «one admires me; I am admired»
<li>{DatoDlu’} = «one saves you; you are saved»
<li>{qagh HoHlu’} = «one eats serpent worm; serpent worn is eaten»
<li>{wIHIvlu’} = «one attacks us; we are attacked»
<li>{bongejlu’} = «one infects you all; you all are infected»
<li>{yIHmey luHoHlu’} = «one kills tribbles; tribbles are killed»
</ul>

In the Duolingo exercises, pay attention for when you are given an English
passive voice sentence and must translate it with the Klingon indefinite
subject.


### {tu’lu’} «There is»

Now you can also understand the forms {tu’lu’} for «there is» and {lutu’lu’}
«there are»: they are based on the verb {tu’} «find, observe».

So {pa’ puq tu’lu’} «there is a child there» literally means «one finds a child
there» or «a child is found there». And {pa’ puqpu’ lutu’lu’} «there are
children there» literally means «one finds children there» or «children are
found there».


### {-lu’} and {-laH}

For reasons that make most sense to Klingon grammarians, it is not possible to
combine the suffixes {-lu’} and {-laH} to create meanings such as «one can see
me; I can be seen» or «one cannot find them; they cannot be found». {-lu’} and
{-laH} are both type 5 verb suffixes, so one or the other of those suffixes can
be on a given verb but not both at once.

If such a meaning is desired, one way to express it is with a locution such as
{muleghlaH vay’} «someone can see me» or {chaH tu’laH pagh} «nobody can find
them» with an explicit subject {vay’} «someone» or {pagh} «nobody».

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 21. Section 2, Unit 13


## Say what you know

<div>[#Sentences-as-objects] Sentences as objects <small title="5747 bytes // 1612073658">6 · 2021-01-31</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Sentences-as-objects/practice"></a></div>

So far, we’ve been using fairly simple sentences—simply main clauses, or main
clauses joined to each other by conjunctions such as {’ej} «and» or {’ach}
«but».

This skill will teach you how Klingons do the equivalent of subordinate
clauses—things such as, «I know that you have eaten my gagh», where the object
of «know» is an entire clause including a verb, «you have eaten my gagh».


### {’e’}

English uses a subordinating conjunction «that» for this; Klingon uses a
special pronoun: {’e’}.

(This is a complete and separate word not to be confused with the topic suffix
{-’e’} that can be added to nouns, such as in «A is a B» sentences.)

This pronoun {’e’} refers to a preceding sentence, and can go into the object
position of a following sentence (i.e. in front of the verb).

For example, if one person says {qettaH mara} «Mara is running», another may
reply, {’e’ vIlegh} «I see that», referring with {’e’} to the previous
sentence, {qettaH mara}.

More commonly, however, the two clauses are spoken by the same speaker,
“connected” with {’e’}. Usually, no punctuation is used after the first
sentence.

So you might also hear: {qettaH mara ’e’ vIlegh}—literally, «Mara is running. I
see that», but equivalent to «I see that Mara is running.»

Note that while in English, we might say, «I know that you ate my gagh,» with
the word “«that»,” or, «I know you have eaten my gagh,» without it, the Klingon
sentence must contain the {’e’}: {qaghwIj DaSoppu’ ’e’ vISov}.

The only exception to this is the verb {neH} which means «to want»—here, the
{’e’} is left out.

For example, a Klingon might say {qagh vISop vIneH} «I want to eat
gagh.»—literally: «I eat gagh. I want that.»

{’e’} counts as a singular object, so something like «We know that the
prisoners eat» would be {Sop qama’pu’ ’e’ wISov}, with the prefix {wI-}
indicating the subject is «we» and the object is «it».

Similarly, «They want us to eat» would be {maSop luneH} (literally: «we eat;
they want that»), with prefix {lu-} indicating subject «they» and object «it,
that».

Don’t be misled by English grammar and use something like {Sop nuneH} to try to
say «they want us—to eat». {nuneH} does mean, «they want us», but you can’t use
it to try to say «they want us—to eat». In this type of sentence, «we» are
doing the eating and so must be represented by the prefix on {Sop}, instead of
on {neH}. The Klingon grammatical object of «want» is the entire previous
sentence (which for other verbs would be represented by the pronoun {’e’}, but
{’e’} is omitted with the verb {neH}).


### {net}

Another special pronoun is {net}.

This acts similarly to {’e’}, but in addition indicates that the subject of the
verb is indefinite or general.

For example, {’e’ Sov} means «he/she knows that», but {net Sov} means «one
knows that; it is known that». This is exactly equivalent to {’e’ Sovlu’}, but
when you want to use {-lu’} with {’e’}, you should use {net} instead. For
example: {val tlhInganpu’ net Sov} «It is known that Klingons are smart; One
knows that Klingons are smart».


### {poQ}

The verb {poQ} does not have one good translation, so it can be confusing. It
is used to indicate a strong desire or something that feels as if it necessary.
It may imply a command or suggest a requirement, but it literally only
expresses that the subject feels the object is very important to them. {poQ} is
often used with {’e’} to indicate what one desires to happen. Most of the time,
this course will translate {poQ} as «demand», but it is important to keep in
mind that it is «demand» as in «require» or «need», not as in «to make a
command». In English one doesn’t «demand» someone else, so when the object is a
person, {poQ} is more often translated «need».


### {jal}

This unit introduces the verb {jal} which is usually translated as «imagine,
envision» and is very often used to express hypothetical situations: {tlhIngan
SoH ’e’ vIjal.} This sentence can be translated directly as «I imagine that you
are a Klingon.»

In English, we often express hypothetical situations like this with a
subjunctive mood conjugation, so we might instead say, «I imagine that you were
a Klingon.» In this course we will accept either the indicative mood (regular
past, present, or future) or the subjunctive mood.

Commands using {’e’} with {jal} may sometimes translate the {’e’} as «if»:
{puvlaH targh ’e’ yIjal} («Imagine if targs could fly.») In this course, we
will accept either «that» or «if» in sentences like this.

Note that the verb suffix {-chugh} also creates a kind of hypothetical
situation. The difference is that a {-chugh} statement is used to indicate a
cause and effect and should include the result of the hypothetical. A {jal}
command is just asking the listener to imagine if such a situation were to
exist.

## Discuss the weather

<div>[#Weather] Weather <small title="1199 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Weather/practice"></a></div>

Some words about weather and weather phenomena.

Note that weather usually involves verbs in Klingon—for example, {SIS} «rain»
is a verb (it rains, it is raining) and there is no specific word for the noun
«rain».

If you wanted to specify that a specific puddle, for example, was formed from
rain and not some other source of water, you could call it {chal bIQ} «sky
water», but that’s more of a description than a separate word for «rain».

Note that English needs a dummy subject «it» with weather verbs (it is raining,
it snowed, etc.) but Klingon does not: {SIStaH, peD} etc. are quite sufficient.
Don’t use {’oH} as there is no «it» there which «does the raining».

Serious weather predictions use the verb {’aq}, which indicates a kind of
prediction that is carried out on the basis of science, research, or deductive
reasoning, rather than guesswork or gut feeling.

If the specific person or group who made the forecast is not named, the
construction is usually {… ’e’ ’aqlu’} «It is predicted that …», though {… net
’aq} is also possible.

## Show confidence

<div>[#Verb-Qualifiers] Verb Qualifiers <small title="2075 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Verb-Qualifiers/practice"></a></div>

This skill introduces type 6 verbal suffixes, which can be used to show how
confident you are about the statement you are making, or how close to reality
the verb is.

There are four of these: {-law’ -bej -ba’ -chu’}


### {-law’}

The verbal suffix {-law’} indicates some degree of doubt—«it seems that…, I
think that…, I suspect that…, apparently…».

For example, {ghunglaw’ puq} means "it seems that the child is hungry; I
suspect that the child is hungry; the child is apparently hungry".


### {-bej}

The verbal suffix {-bej} indicates a high degree of confidence. It can be
translated as «certainly», «definitely», or «undoubtedly».


### {-ba’}

The verbal suffix {-ba’} indicates that something is obvious.

For example, {nepba’taH qama’} would mean «the prisoner is obviously lying».
(Note the order of the suffixes: the type 6 suffix {-ba’} «obviously» comes
before the type 7 aspect suffix {-taH} «-ing».)


### {-chu’}

The verbal suffix {-chu’} can be translated as «clearly», «perfectly», or
«completely», depending on the sentence.

Note in this connection that the placement of the negative suffix {-be’}
matters when there are multiple suffixes, as it acts on the one in front of it.

So {qayajlaHbe’chu’} ({qa-} «I-you», {yaj} «understand», {-laH} «can, able»,
{-be’} «not», {-chu’} «completely») means something like "I am completely
unable to understand you, i.e. the {-laHbe’} «not able» state is perfect or
complete.

On the other hand, {qayajlaHchu’be’} would mean something like «I can
understand you, but not perfectly», i.e. the {-laH} «able» state is {-chu’be’}
«not perfect».

These distinctions are sometimes a bit difficult to capture naturally in
English.


## Express certainty

<div>[#Noun-Qualifiers] Noun Qualifiers <small title="1866 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Noun-Qualifiers/practice"></a></div>

This skill introduces you to the three type 3 noun suffixes {-qoq -Hey -na’},
which indicate the speaker’s attitude towards the noun, or how sure the speaker
is that the noun is being used appropriately.

These are tricky to translate into natural English; sometimes, an adverb or
verb may work better than an adjective.


### {-qoq}

The suffix {-qoq} indicates that the noun is being used ironically or otherwise
not with its literal meaning. «So-called» is usually a good translation. It’s
similar to the practice of using “finger quotes”.

For example, if someone is asking a question “for a friend,” the listener might
inquire about {jupqoqlI’} «your so-called friend» or «your “friend.”»


### {-Hey}

The suffix {-Hey} indicates that the speaker is not sure what the object he is
discussing is but suspects that it may be this noun.

For example, if the speaker sees a humanoid figure in the distance and thinks
it might be a Ferengi, but isn’t sure yet because he can’t see clearly enough,
he might call say {verenganHey vIlegh}. «I see an apparent Ferengi» might be a
translation, or perhaps a rewording to «I see what might be a Ferengi» or «I
think I see a Ferengi» or «I suspect that it’s a Ferengi that I see» might
capture the sense of the Klingon sentence better.


### {-na’}

The suffix {-na’}, on the other hand, indicates that the speaker is sure that
the word he/she is using is appropriate.

If, in the previous example, the humanoid comes close enough that the speaker
can clearly discern their brow ridge and the shape of their ears and knows
without a doubt that it is, indeed, a Ferengi, he may use the word
{verenganna’} «definitely a Ferengi, an undoubted Ferengi» to describe him.

# 24. Section 2, Unit 16


## Talk about size

<div>[#Lengths-and-Measurements] Lengths and Measurements <small title="2571 bytes // 1553371979">4 · 2019-03-23</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Lengths-and-Measurements/practice"></a></div>

This skill introduces various words for measuring things and saying how long or
wide etc. they are.


### {’ab}

The word {’ab} means specifically «to have a height of …», but due to a
difference in how English and Klingon measures things, it may sometimes be
translated as «to have a length of …».

For something that effectively has only one measurement (in other words, it has
a significantly greater measure in one dimension than in the other two—such as
a pole or a rope), {’ab} will give you the measurement of that greatest
dimension. In English we usually call this the length, but Klingons call it the
height. Klingons apparently imagine measuring such long objects standing on
end, instead of stretched out along a surface.


### {juch} and {’aD}

The word {juch} means «to have a width of …» and the word {’aD} means «to have
a length of …»

For something that effectively has only two measurements (in other words, one
of the dimensions is negligible compared to the other two—such as a lid or a
table top), {’aD} will give you the length and {juch} will give you the width.
Klingons apparently imagine measuring such flat objects lying down and not
standing up on the edge.

When measurements are given for all three dimensions of a being or thing, then
the actual orientation is considered and {’ab} is used for height, {juch} is
used for width, and {’aD} is used for length (sometimes called «depth» in
English, but only for depth going back, {’aD} is never used for depth under a
surface).


### {Saw’}

The word {Saw’} means «to have a depth of …» and is used for giving the
measurement of depth under a surface.


### {’uj}

Measurements in this skill are in Klingon units: {’uj} and {’uj’a’}, translated
here as «uj» and «uja» (i.e. the English names are just the Klingon words
without the apostrophes), pluralized as «ujes» and «ujas», respectively.

We do not ask you to convert between Klingon units and English units in this
course, so you do not need to memorize the exact length of an uj or uja.
However, in case you would like to know, an «uj» is about 35 cm or 14 inches,
an «uja» is nine «ujes», so about 3.15 m or 124 inches (10 foot 4).


## Say what someone does

<div>[#Agent-nouns] Agent nouns <small title="901 bytes // 1676547420">2 · 2023-02-16</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Agent-nouns/practice"></a></div>

This skill introduces the suffix {-wI’}.

It is added to verbs and produces nouns.

Similar to the English suffix {-er}, those nouns refer to a person who does
that action or an item which does that action.

For example, from {bom} (to sing), we get {bomwI’} «singer» (a person who
sings) and from {poSmoH} (to open) we might make {poSmoHwI’} «opener» (a tool
that opens things, or a person who opens things).

You have seen this suffix before as part of some nouns such as {SuvwI’},
{chungwI’} or {ghoqwI’}.

A few nouns in {-wI’} have an unpredictable meaning, however, such as {De’wI’}
«computer»; there is a noun {De’} «data, information» but no (known) verb
{De’}.

## Use diminutives

<div>[#Greater-and-lesser] Greater and lesser <small title="5420 bytes // 1576501403">1 · 2019-12-16</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Greater-and-lesser/practice"></a></div>

This unit will introduce the type 1 noun suffixes. There are three such
suffixes and they are {-’a’}, {-Hom}, and {-oy}. These suffixes will always
come before any other suffixes (with the exception that if they are being
placed on a noun formed from a verb with the type 9 verb suffixes {-wI’} or
{-ghach}, then any verb suffixes retained in creating the noun will be before
the noun suffixes).


### {-’a’} «augmentative»

This suffix is placed on a noun to indicate that you are talking about a
different version of the noun which is in some way greater, more significant,
or more major to the normal, unmarked version of the noun. The difference is
usually more than just a simple size difference (which should be indicated,
instead, with the verb {tIn}), but indicates a difference in power, capability,
or importance.

A {bIQ’a’} is not just a big area of water, it is an «ocean» or a «sea». A
{pIn’a’} («master») could actually be physically smaller than a {pIn} («boss»)
in the same field. And while the {vaS’a’} («Great Hall») is bigger than the
typical {vaS} («assymbly hall»), what makes it the {vaS’a’} is the importance
and power of the Klingon government that is seated there.

There is not really one good way to translate the suffix into English. Some
words might actually change completely to reflect the difference in English. A
{Duy} is an «agent» or «emissary» and a {Duy’a’} would be an «ambassador». When
there are not different English words available, you will often see {-’a’}
translated as, «great», though this can be confused with meaning, «wonderful»,
and {-’a’} does not necessarily carry that connotation. Sometimes the word
«major» works well, though in military contexts, this can be confused with the
Terran military rank.

Please note that this suffix is *not* related to the identical looking
interrogative verb suffix {-’a’}. As you can see above, the noun suffix has a
completely different meaning from the verb suffix.


### {-Hom} «diminutive»

This suffix indicates the opposite quality from {-’a’}. {-Hom} marks a noun
which is in some way a lessor, more insignificant, or more minor version of
that noun. Again, size can play a role, but is usually not the determining
factor (otherwise, you might be better off using the verb {mach}).

{be’Hompu’} and {loDHompu’} are not just tiny {be’pu’} and {loDpu’}, but
actually a *minor* version of those things (pun intended). While a {lupDuj} is
a «transport ship», a {lupDujHom} is nothing more than a «shuttlecraft». And
though a {veng} would be a bustling «city», a {vengHom} would just be a
«village».

We see, again, in the words introduced above, the tendency to actually use
different English words, when available to translate the different concepts.
Though at times, there isn’t a different word available and words like «lesser»
or «minor» are often used to translate the {-Hom} suffix.

A good Klingon word to demonstrate all three version of one concept, might be
the word {SuS}, which is translated «wind, breeze», and with the {-’a’} suffix
becomes a {SuS’a’} («strong wind») or with the {-Hom} suffix becomes a {SuSHom}
(«wisp of air»).


### {-oy} «endearment»

This suffix is rarely used by adults, especially in military or formal
settings. It is most often used by children and applied to relatives and pets.
It indicates a particular fondness, usually by the speaker, for the noun that
it is attached to. A child might call their {SoS} («mother»), {SoSoy}
(«mommy»), and their {vav} («father»), {vavoy} («daddy»). While native speakers
may have a good understanding of when or how to use this suffix, it is not
recommended that adult learners use this suffix unless they are absolutely
certain they understand what the ramifications will be.

Note that the {-oy} suffix is the only known syllable of the Klingon language
that begins with a vowel. All other known syllables of the Klingon language
start with a consonant (remember that the {qaghwI’} is a consonant). There are
more than a few syllables that end with a vowel, but no other syllables that
begin with a vowel. This could cause a theoretical problem if a noun ending in
a vowel might have the suffix {-oy} placed on it, thus causing there to be two
adjacent vowels (which is not allowed in usual Klingon spelling and
pronunciation). No encounter of such a word has ever been reported by English
speaking students of Klingon, but it has been speculated that Klingons might
actually insert a {qaghwI’} between the two syllables in such a case.

This skill shows how to express elementary arithmetic in Klingon.

We teach decimals, which use {vI’}, and how to express addition and
subtraction.

The way these are worded is rather different from how English does it, so they
will be explained here.


### Addition

A mathematical expression such as {4 + 3 = 7} is read in English in pretty much
the same order as it is written down: «four plus three equals seven».

Klingon uses the verbs {boq} «ally with» and {chen} «form; take shape» in such
sentences and would read that as {wej boq loS; chen Soch}—literally, «four
allies with three; seven forms».

In other words, one number allies with another one, and the result is that a
new number (the result) takes shape, comes into being, forms.

In such mathematical expressions, the numbers are considered singular. For
example, {8 + 1 = 9} is {wa’ boq chorgh; chen Hut}, where the verb {boq} is in
the form for *singular subject, singular object*—it does not take the prefix
{lu-} for *plural subject, singular object* since the {chorgh} in that
expression is considered singular: a “pure number” rather than a count of
multiple things.


### Subtraction

Subtraction proceeds in a similar manner to addition, using the verb {boqHa’}
«dis-ally» or «dissociate from».

For example, {13 − 8 = 5} would be read as {wa’maH wej boqHa’ chorgh; chen
vagh}—literally, «eight dissociates from thirteen; five forms.»


### Big numbers

This unit introduces number suffixes for bigger numbers: {-netlh} for 10,000,
{-bIp} for 100,000, and {-’uy’} for 1,000,000.

These work just like the suffixes {-maH}, {-vatlh}, {-SaD}/{-SanID} which you
have already learned, for example, {vaghnetlh} is 50,000 and {cha’bIp wejnetlh
SochmaH} is 230,070.


### Multiplication and division

Expressing multiplication and division works a bit like addition and
subtraction, involving the verb {boq} «ally with» and {chen} «form, come into
being».


#### Multiplication

Multiplication is essentially repeated adding—4×8 is like adding 8 to itself
four times.

So in Klingon, multiplication uses the verb {boq’egh} «allies with itself»,
formed from {boq} «ally with» and the suffix {-’egh} which indicates that the
action of the verb is directed back at the subject itself.

For example, {4 × 8 = 32} is expressed as {loSlogh boq’egh chorgh; chen wejmaH
cha’} «four times, eight allies with itself; thirty-two forms.»


#### Division

Division involves the verb {boqHa’’egh} «dissociates from itself»—for example,
{27 ÷ 3 = 9} is expressed as {wejlogh boqHa’’egh cha’maH Soch; chen Hut} or
literally, «twenty-seven dissociates from itself three times; nine forms.»


#### Percentage

A percentage may be expressed by following a number with {vatlhvI’}. «1%» may
be expressed as {wa’ vatlhvI’}. We do not know of a way to express other
fractions.

# 27. Section 2, Unit 19


## Use relative clauses

<div>[#Relative-clauses] Relative clauses <small title="3785 bytes // 1580420878">5 · 2020-01-31</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Relative-clauses/practice"></a></div>

This skill teaches how to form relative clauses such as «the book which I am
reading» or «the man who is guarding us».


### {-bogh}

This is done through the use of the type 9 verb suffix, {-bogh}.

From {paq vIlaDtaH} «I am reading a book», we get {paq vIlaDtaHbogh} «the book
which I am reading», and from {nu’avtaH loD} «the man is guarding us», we get
{nu’avtaHbogh loD} «the man who is guarding us».

Such a relative clause forms a noun phrase which can then serve as the subject
or object of a main clause—for example, «Mara is looking for [the book which I
am reading]», {paq vIlaDtaHbogh nej mara} or «[The man who is guarding us]
refuses to fall asleep» {QongchoHQo’ nu’avtaHbogh loD}.


### Head Nouns

If the relative clause only mentions a subject or only mentions an object, as
in the previous examples, then it is clear whether the subject or the object of
that clause is the thing being referred to.

If, on the other hand, a clause has both an explicit subject and an explicit
object, then adding {-bogh} to the verb does not make it clear whether the
subject or the object of that clause is the *head noun* (i.e. the one intended
to be relativized). For example, {paq ghajbogh be’} can either mean «the book
which the woman has» or «the woman who has the book».

Context may make it clear which meaning is intended, but if you want to be more
specific, you can use the type 5 noun suffix {-’e’} on the head noun which you
want to “extract” or relativise; thus {paq’e’ ghajbogh be’} is explicitly «the
book which the woman has» and {paq ghajbogh be’’e’} is explicitly «the woman
who has the book».

This use of the type 5 noun suffix {-’e’} is related to other uses like topic,
focus, or emphasis, but does not typically indicate any of those things when
used along with the {-bogh} verb suffix. In this case it is usually just
marking which noun is being relativized.


### Choice of type 5 suffixes

If you want the noun phrase formed with {-bogh} to be used as something other
than the subject, object, or topic, other syntactic noun suffixes can be placed
on the head noun instead of {-’e’}. For instance, you can use {-Daq} to
indicate that the phrase describes the location, you can use {-vo’} to indicate
that the phrase describes the origin, you can use {-mo’} to indicate the phrase
describes the cause, or you can use {-vaD} to indicate that the phrase
describes the indirect object. In each of these cases, the entire {-bogh}
phrase marked in this way would be placed before the OVS structure of the
sentence.


### Multiple Adjectives

Note that when using adjectival verbs like {chu’} («be new»), using {-bogh} for
a relative clause has basically the same meaning as placing the adjectival verb
after the noun. The noun phrases {paq chu’} («a new book») and {chu’bogh paq}
(«a book which is new») effectively mean the same thing.

Relative clauses using {-bogh} are a good way to add additional adjectives to a
noun. We are not allowed to put two adjectival verbs after a noun, so we cannot
say *{paq QaQ chu’} for «a good new book». Instead, we can use the {-bogh}
suffix on one of the verbs to create a more complex noun phrase:
<br>{QaQbogh paq chu’} «a new book that is good» or
<br>{chu’bogh paq QaQ} «a good book that is new»


## Discuss fingers and toes

<div>[#Fingers] Fingers <small title="2662 bytes // 1540473471">1 · 2018-10-25</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Fingers/practice"></a></div>


### Left and right

Two new words here are {poS} «left side» and {nIH} «right side». These are
nouns, so «on the left side» would be {poSDaq}, for example.


### Fingers and toes

Klingons’ hands and feet are very flexible, and they can easily move each of
their fingers or toes independently of the others.


#### Verbs

There is a separate verb for each of these digit movements, e.g. {SIq} «to use
the index finger» or {nan} «to use the fourth toe».

The object of such a verb, if present, is the item which is manipulated or
touched with that finger or toe, similar to the English usage of «to thumb a
switch» = «to flip a switch using the thumb».

If the verb has no object, but there is a noun with the locative suffix {-Daq},
then the meaning of the finger/toe verbs is «point»—for example, {lurvengDaq
jISIq} «I ‘indexfinger’ at Lurveng» would mean «I point at Lurveng with my
index finger».

The verbs taught here are:

<ul>
<li>{Sen} «to use the thumb»
<li>{SIq} «to use the index finger»
<li>{qay} «to use the middle finger»
<li>{qew} «to use the ring finger»
<li>{qan} «to use the pinkie finger»
</ul>

*(Those who live in New York State may be reminded of the Finger Lakes, which
include {Sen}eca, {Sk}aneateles, {Cay}uga, {Keu}ka, and {Can}andaigua Lake.)*

for the fingers and

<ul>
<li>{mar} «to use the big toe»
<li>{Hom} «to use the second toe»
<li>{roS} «to use the third toe»
<li>{nan} «to use the fourth toe»
<li>{Qay’} «to use the little toe»
</ul>

*(Any similarities to the nursery rhyme “This little piggy went to {mar}ket,
this little piggy stayed at {home}; this little piggy has {roast} beef, this
little piggy had {none}. And this little piggy {cried} ‘Wee, wee, wee!’ all the
way home” that some families play on infants’ toes are almost certainly
coincidental.)*


#### Nouns

The names of the fingers and toes are derived from the verbs with the agent
suffix {-wI’}.

Thus a thumb is a {SenwI’}—literally, a «thumb-er» or «thing which thumbs» or
«thing which is used in a thumb-like manner»—an index finger is a {SIqwI’}, and
so on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 28. Section 2, Unit 20


## Say where something is

<div>[#location-nouns] Location nouns <small title="4955 bytes // 1551617029">2 · 2019-03-03</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/location-nouns/practice"></a></div>

In English, an object’s location is normally indicated using prepositions, such
as «under», «over» and «next to».

In Klingon, on the other hand, such concepts are most commonly described using
a nouns referring to areas and surfaces. Examples include:

<table border=1 style="width:1px;white-space:nowrap">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Klingon</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{bIng}</td>
<td>«area below, area under»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{Dung}</td>
<td>«area above, area over»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{tlhop}</td>
<td>«area in front of»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{’em}</td>
<td>«area behind»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{retlh}</td>
<td>«area next to»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To express a spatial relationship to an object, we can use a simple noun-noun
construction:

{nagh retlh} «the area next to the rock»

{QI bIng} «the area below the bridge»

This can then be combined with the suffixes {-Daq} and {-vo’} to describe an
object’s location or motion in relation to another.

{nagh retlhDaq jIHtaH.} «I am next to the rock.»

{QI bIngDaq ’oHtaH nagh’e’.} «The rock is below the bridge.»

{QI bIngvo’ maqet.} «We ran from the area below the bridge.»


### Special place nouns

There are a handful of place nouns which never take the suffix {-Daq}. These
are:

<table border=1 style="width:1px;white-space:nowrap">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Klingon</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{naDev}</td>
<td>«here, hereabouts»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{pa’}</td>
<td>«there, thereabouts»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{Dat}</td>
<td>«everywhere»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{vogh}</td>
<td>«somewhere»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As such, the following two sentences are correct:

{naDev jIHtaH.} «I am here.»

{Dat naghmey tu’lu’.} «There are rocks everywhere.»

{vogh ’oHbejtaH.} «It is definitely somewhere.»

However, the following three sentences would *not* be correct:

Wrong: {naDevDaq jIHtaH.}

Wrong: {DatDaq naghmey tu’lu’.}

Wrong: {voghDaq ’oHbejtaH.}

Note that these words may still take the suffix {-vo’}. For example:

{naDevvo’ yIghoS!} «Go away (from here)!»
{pa’vo’ yIttaH.} «They are walking away from there.»


### The dual meaning of {pa’}

The word {pa’} is an interesting case, as it has two completely separate
definitions:

1. {pa’} «there, thereabouts»
2. {pa’} «room»

This can cause some confusion, but context will usually make it clear which
meaning is intended. Also, because the first use of the word is never combined
with the suffix {-Daq}, this can sometimes be used to disambiguate:

{pa’ chaHtaH.} «They are there.»

{pa’Daq chaHtaH.} «They are in the room.»


### Interior and exterior surfaces

In Klingon, one always distinguishes between the interior and exterior top of
an object, as well as between the interior and exterior bottom. The interior
surfaces are those which can be seen from the inside, while the exterior
surfaces are those which can be seen from the outside.

<table border=1 style="width:1px;white-space:nowrap">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Klingon</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{bIS’ub}</td>
<td>«interior bottom»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{’aqroS}</td>
<td>«interior top»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{pIrmuS}</td>
<td>«exterior bottom»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{yor}</td>
<td>«exterior top»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This distinction may sound somewhat technical at first glance, but it can be
illustrated using an example from everyday life:

Let’s say you live in an apartment on the second floor of a building. Looking
up and down, you can easily see your apartment’s *interior* surfaces: You call
the interior bottom ({bIS’ub}) your «floor» ({rav}), and you call the interior
top ({’aqroS}) your «ceiling» ({rav’eq}).

The *exterior* surfaces, however, are not visible from inside your apartment.
The exterior bottom ({pIrmuS}) of your apartment is the ceiling of the
apartment *below* you.

Likewise, the exterior top ({yor}) of your apartment is the floor of the
apartment above yours. Alternatively, if you live on the top floor, the
exterior top of your apartment will be part of the exterior top of the building
itself: Its «roof» ({beb}).

(We will discuss architectural terms in more detail in the next lesson.)

Miscellaneous vocabulary connected to magic: both “real” magic with spells and
also stage magic, the illusionist’s craft.


### Real magic

Regardless of whether you believe that real magic and proper wizards exist,
Klingons have words for such concepts.

«Magic» is {’IDnar}, and a wizard or sorceror is a {’IDnar pIn’a’} (literally,
a «master of magic») or a {reSwI’} (literally, a «spellcaster»).

A magic spell is a {tlheH}, and the verb for them is {reS} (cast). It can be
used either with an object ({tlheH reS ’IDnar pIn’a’} «the wizard cast a
spell») or without ({reStaH ’IDnar pIn’a’} «the wizard is casting spells»).


### Stage magic

In English, «magic» can also be used to refer to what an illusionist does
during a magic show—pretend to violate the laws of physics through
misdirection, sleight of hand, etc. rather than through supernatural powers.

To do so is to {mIn yuq} «outwit the eyes»; a stage magician or illusionist can
thus be called a {mIn yuqwI’}.

Another word for a stage magician is {’IDnar lIlwI’}, literally a «magic
simulator»—to {lIl} is to simulate something or impersonate someone (but
without attempt to defraud). {’IDnar lIl} (literally, to simulate magic) is
another verb for what a stage magician does.


### {lIlIllI’}

A final, humorous note: when Marc Okrand passed on the information about these
magic-related words from his Klingon informant, Maltz, he added a post-script
saying that “My favorite sentence at the moment is «They are (continuously and
with some sort of goal in mind) impersonating you (plural).»”

Or in other words: {lIlIllI’}.

# 32. Section 3, Unit 4


## Turn verbs into nouns

<div>[#Nominalization] Nominalization <small title="2480 bytes // 1576501403">2 · 2019-12-16</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Nominalization/practice"></a></div>

As you become more and more experienced in speaking Klingon, you may discover
that your Klingon sentences tend to contain a larger concentration of verbs
than your English sentences.

For example:

English: «The patient’s illness was brought on by sleeplessness.» (1 verb, 3
nouns)

Klingon: {QonglaHbe’mo’ SID ropchoH.} (2 verbs, 1 noun)

Back-translated: «Because the patient couldn’t sleep, she/he became sick.»

However, every now and then, it is useful to be able to describe an action or a
state using a noun rather than a verb. For example, what if you wish to say
«his so-called sleeplessness», or «the illness that was caused by her
sleeplessness»?

This is where the useful—but rarely heard—nominalization suffix {-ghach} comes
in. This suffix takes a verb which has at least one other verb suffix and turns
it into a noun that describes the action or state corresponding to that verb.
For example:

<table border=1 style="width:1px;white-space:nowrap">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Verb</th>
<th>English</th>
<th>Noun</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{laDtaH}</td>
<td>«is ongoing reading»</td>
<td>{laDtaHghach}</td>
<td>«(the act of) ongoing reading»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{’IQtaH}</td>
<td>«is continuously sad»</td>
<td>{’IQtaHghach}</td>
<td>«continuous sadness»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{QalvIp}</td>
<td>«is afraid to swim»</td>
<td>{QalvIpghach}</td>
<td>«fear of swimming»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{QonglaHbe’}</td>
<td>«can’t sleep»</td>
<td>{QonglaHbe’ghach}</td>
<td>«sleeplessness, insomnia»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{lujchu’}</td>
<td>«fail utterly»</td>
<td>{lujchu’ghach}</td>
<td>«utter failure»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Further reading</h3>

You can read more about the {-ghach} suffix in *The Klingon Dictionary*, in
section 4.2.9. of the addendum.

Advanced students may also be interested in [this HolQeD
article](http://klingonska.org/canon/1994-09-holqed-03-3-a.txt), which explores
the tricky subject of using {-ghach} on a naked verb stem (i.e. {nobghach}) or
on a verb with a pronominal prefix (i.e. {jInobghach}). This, however, is
beyond the scope of this course.


## Talk about art

<div>[#Culture] Culture <small title="2768 bytes // 1610636699">2 · 2021-01-14</small><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/skill/kl/Culture/practice"></a></div>

This skill teaches vocabulary related to culture and the arts. There is no new
grammar taught in this Skill, but a few of the words may be worth exploring in
greater detail.


### {meHghem}

It’s been suggested that there is no single word in Klingon that corresponds to
the English word «art». …but then again, that is perhaps to be expected, seeing
as it can be difficult enough to find two English-speakers who agree entirely
on what exactly «art» is. Are video games art? Is twerking art? Are these Skill
Tips art? I’m not sure the answer is any clearer in Klingon than in English.

The Klingon word {meHghem} has been variously translated as «art», «the arts»
and «culture», and encompasses a broad range of creative expression, including
the visual arts (such as sculpture and painting) as well as music, drama,
poetry, theatre and more.

In discussing Earth culture, the phrase {meHghem Qat} is sometimes used to
refer to «pop culture».


### {vIqraq}

Although most people will agree that painting is a form of art, many will also
argue that not *every* painting is a work of art. Indeed, no visit to a modern
art exhibit would be complete without somebody exclaiming «You call this art?
My five-year-old could have made this!»

The word {vIqraq} has been variously translated as «work of art», «artwork»,
«artifact», «gizmo», «gadget» and more, but a more general translation would be
«something that is manufactured/made».

As such, it could describe a quilt, a machine, a necklace, a flower
arrangement, a piece of furniture and much more. It also encompasses any
sculpture or painting … as well as any drawing made by the above mentioned
five-year-old.


### {nagh beQ}

The phrase {nagh beQ} is commonly translated as «picture» or «painting».
However, broken down, it literally means «flat stone». This phrase originally
referred to stone panels with engraved pictures on them, but this usage has
since been expanded to encompass a much larger range of flat images.

Note that this phrase consists of a noun ({nagh}) modified by a state-of-being
verb ({beQ}). As such, noun suffixes of Types 1-4 are added to the first word,
while the type 5 noun suffixes ({-Daq}, {-vo’}, {-vaD}, {-mo’} and {-’e’}) are
added to the second. For example:

{naghmey beQ} «the paintings»

{nagh beQmo’} «because of the painting»

{vIqraqmey bIHba’ moHbogh naghmeyvam beQ’e’.} «These ugly paintings are
obviously {vIqraqmey}.»

Congratulations on reaching the last unit of this course! (for now)

You will find here miscellaneous vocabulary for plants and animals more
familiar to us on Earth than to Klingons, as well as names of some countries
and continents on Earth.

If your country isn’t among the list, please rest assured that this is not a
deliberate slight—we don’t know the official Klingon names for all countries
yet, and we don’t have unlimited space in this lesson, either.
